The new Chebfun release v5.7.0 brings with it a new set of capabilities: smooth random functions. The commands are `randnfun`, `randnfun2`, `randnfunsphere`, and `randnfundisk`.  (There is not yet a `randnfun3`.)  Each of these returns a band-limited function defined by a Fourier series with independent random coefficients; a parameter $\lambda$ specifies the minimal wavelength.  For information about the mathematics, see [1] and also chapter 12 of [2].

<pre class="mcode-input">help randnfun</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> RANDNFUN   Smooth random function
    F = RANDNFUN(LAMBDA) returns a CHEBFUN on [-1,1] with maximum
    frequency &lt;= 2pi/LAMBDA and standard normal distribution N(0,1)
    at each point.  F can be regarded as a sample path of a Gaussian
    process.  It is obtained by calling RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'trig') on an
    interval 20% longer and restricting the result to [-1,1].
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, DOM) returns a result with domain DOM = [A, B].
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, N) returns a quasimatrix with N independent columns.
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'big') normalizes the output by dividing it by
    SQRT(LAMBDA/2), so white noise is approached in the limit LAMBDA -&gt; 0,
    with an indefinite integral corresponding to standard Brownian motion.
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'trig') returns a random periodic function.  This
    is defined by a finite Fourier-Wiener series with independent normally
    distributed coefficients of equal variance.
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'complex') returns a complex random function.  The
    variance is the same as in the real case (i.e., not twice as great).
 
    RANDNFUN() uses the default value LAMBDA = 1.  Combinations such
    as RANDNFUN(DOM) and RANDNFUN('big', LAMBDA) are allowed so long as
    N, if present, is preceded by an explicit specification of LAMBDA.

    plot(cumsum(randnfun(.01,[0 5],'complex','big'))), axis equal

</pre>These commands make it easy to compute sample paths of random ODEs in Chebfun, that is, of ODEs defined by smooth random coefficients. As $\lambda \to 0$, we approach the limit of stochastic DEs (SDEs) in their Stratonovich (as opposed to It&ocirc;) formulation. Thus Chebfun provides an easy window into the phenomena that make SDEs so fascinating and so important.  Note that what Chebfun solves is a random ODE (based on band-limited randomness), not an SDE (based on band-unlimited randomness, i.e., white noise, a notion made precise through the formulation of a Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion). In the limit $\lambda\to 0$ they are the same (though Chebfun becomes quite an inefficient tool if you try to get too close to that limit).

For ODE-related studies, one should always call `randnfun` and its cousins with the flag `'big'`.  This multiplies the random function by $(\lambda/2)^{-1/2}$, meaning that its amplitude grows without bound as $\lambda\to 0$.  This is what is needed for random ODEs to approximate SDEs.

Here we give just the simplest example.  If $f$ is a normalized random function, then the equation $$ u' = f $$ has the indefinite integral of $f$ as its solution.  We call this a "smooth random walk".  If $\lambda$ is small enough, it looks to the eye like true Brownian motion, and as $\lambda \to 0$, that is what it approaches. For finite $\lambda$ there are no mathematical technicalities to worry about; it is simply an ODE.  Precise statements about the limit $\lambda\to 0$ require care, however, and stochastic analysts would write the equation above in a very different form, $$ dX_t = d W_t. $$

Here are three smooth random walk sample paths for $t\in [0,1]$ with $u(0) = 0$ and $\lambda = 0.001$.
