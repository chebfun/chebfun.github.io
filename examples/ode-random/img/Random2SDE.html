The new Chebfun release v5.7.0 brings with it a new set of capabilities: smooth random functions, or as we will often simply call them, random functions.  The commands are `randnfun`, `randnfun2`, `randnfunsphere`, and `randnfundisk`.  (As of this writing there is not yet a `randnfun3`.)  Each of these returns a band-limited function defined by a Fourier series with independent random coefficients; a parameter $\lambda$ specifies the minimal wavelength.  These commands have not yet been fully written up, but a few examples can be found in the Approximation (1D), Approximation (2D), and Statistics and Probability sections of these Examples, and more details can be found in the help texts and Matlab codes.

<pre class="mcode-input">help randnfun</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> RANDNFUN   Random smooth function
    F = RANDNFUN(LAMBDA) returns a smooth CHEBFUN on [-1,1] with maximum
    frequency about 2pi/LAMBDA and standard normal distribution N(0,1)
    at each point.  F can be regarded as one sample path of a Gaussian
    process.  It is obtained by calling RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'trig') on an
    interval about 20% longer and restricting the result to [-1,1].
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, DOM) returns a result with domain DOM = [A, B].
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, N) returns a quasimatrix with N independent columns.
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'norm') normalizes the output by dividing it by
    SQRT(LAMBDA), so white noise is approached in the limit LAMBDA -&gt; 0.
 
    RANDNFUN(LAMBDA, 'trig') returns a random periodic function.  This
    is defined by a finite Fourier series with independent normally
    distributed coefficients of equal variance.
 
    RANDNFUN() uses the default value LAMBDA = 1.  Combinations such
    as RANDNFUN(DOM), RANDNFUN('norm', LAMBDA) are allowed so long as
    LAMBDA, if present, precedes N, if present.
 
  Examples:
 
    f = randnfun(0.1); std(f), plot(f)
    plotcoeffs(f, '.'), xlim([0 200])
 
    X = randnfun(.01,2); cov(X)
 
    f = randnfun(0.1,'norm',[0 10]); plot(cumsum(f))

</pre>These commands make it easy to compute sample paths of random ODEs in Chebfun, that is, of ODEs defined by smooth random coefficients. As $\lambda \to 0$, we approach the limit of stochastic DEs (SDEs), typically in their Stratonovich (as opposed to It&ocirc;) formulation.  This too has not been written up.  Precise statements relating Chebfun's random functions to SDEs are not yet available, but we expect them to be developed in due course, building for example on the theory of Wong and Zakai [1].  But we don't need a fully developed theory to start exploring!  Chebfun provides an easy window into some of the phenomena that make SDEs so fascinating and so important.  Just remember that, properly speaking, what Chebfun solves is a random ODE (based on band-limited randomness), not a true SDE (based on band-unlimited randomness, i.e., white noise, a notion made precise through the formulation of a Wiener process, also known as Brownian motion).

For studies of this kind, one should always call `randnfun` and its cousins with the flag `'norm'`.  This multiplies the random function by $\lambda^{-1/2}$, meaning that its amplitude grows without bound as $\lambda\to 0$.  This is what is needed for random ODEs that are intended to approximate SDEs.

Here we give just the simplest example.  If $f$ is a normalized random function, then the equation $$ u' = f $$ has the indefinite integral of $f$ as its solution.  We call this a "smooth random walk".  If $\lambda$ is small enough, it looks to the eye like true Brownian motion, and as $\lambda \to 0$, that is what it approaches. For finite $\lambda$ there are no mathematical technicalities to worry about; it is simply an ODE.  Precise statements about the limit $\lambda\to 0$ require care, however, and stochastic analysts would write the equation above in a very different form, $$ dX_t = d W_t. $$

Here are three smooth random walk sample paths for $t\in [0,1]$ with $u(0) = 0$ and $\lambda = 0.001$.
