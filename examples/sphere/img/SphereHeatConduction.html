## 1. Introduction

Spherefun has about 100 commands for computing with scalar- and vector-valued functions [1]. There is also some functionality for solving partial differential equations with the `poisson` and `helmholtz` commands.  In this example, we show how the latter can be used to solve the heat equation on the sphere using an implicit time-stepping scheme.

The example code presented here can easily be adapted to solve more complicated equations involving diffusion.



## 2. Heat equation on the sphere


The heat equation on the sphere is defined by
\begin{equation}
    u_t  =  \alpha\nabla^2 u,
\end{equation}
where $\nabla^2$ is the surface Laplacian (Laplace-Beltrami) operator and
$\alpha&gt;0$ is the coefficient of thermal diffusivity.  The definition is
completed by imposing an initial condition $u(\lambda,\theta,0) =
u_0(\lambda,\theta,0)$, where $-\pi \leq \lambda \leq \pi$ is the
longitudinal coordinate on the sphere and $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi$ is the
latitudinal coordinate.




## 3. Implicit time discretization


In this example we consider discretizing (1) using the second-order
backward differentiation formula (BDF2). In this method, the
time derivative $u_t$ in (1) is replaced by the second-order accurate
approximation $u_t \approx (3u_{n+1} - 4u_{n} + u_{n-1})/(2\Delta t)$,
where $\Delta t$ is the time step and $u_n$ denotes the (approximate)
solution at time $t=n\Delta t$. Substituting this into (1) and
solving for $u_{n+1}$ gives the following partial differential equation
(PDE) for the approximate solution $u_{n+1}$:
 \begin{equation}
 3 u_{n+1} - 2\Delta t \alpha \nabla^2 u_{n+1} = 4 u_{n} - u_{n-1}.
 \end{equation}
This equation can be rearranged as follows to reveal that it is a
standard Helmholtz equation:
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 u_{n+1} + K^2 u_{n+1} = \frac{K^2}{3}(4 u_{n} - u_{n-1}),
\end{equation}
where $K^2 = -3/(2 \Delta t \alpha)$.


The Spherefun command `helmholtz` can be used to solve (3) with optimal complexity [2].



## 4. An example with an analytic solution


We first consider solving (1) with an initial condition given by the
following sum of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell}^{m}(\lambda,\theta)$:
$$ u_0(\lambda,\theta,0) = Y_{6}^{0}(\lambda,\theta) +
\sqrt{\frac{14}{11}} Y_{6}^{6}(\lambda,\theta), $$
which is sometimes called the soccer ball function.  First, we
construct this initial condition in Spherefun and plot it.


<pre class="mcode-input">u0 = spherefun.sphharm(6,0) + sqrt(14/11)*spherefun.sphharm(6,5);
plot(u0), colormap(flipud(hot)), caxis([-1 1.5]), colorbar, axis('off')</pre><img src="img/SphereHeatConduction_01.png" class="figure" alt="">


Since $Y_{\ell}^{m}$ is an eigenfunction of the surface Laplacian
with eigenvalue $-\ell(\ell+1)$, the exact solution to (1) with the above
initial condition is
$$ u(\lambda,\theta,t) = e^{-42\alpha t} u_0(\lambda,\theta). $$


The code below solves (1) numerically with the discretization given in (3) to time $t=1$ using a time step of $\Delta t = 0.01$ and $\alpha=1/42$. Note that to bootstrap the BDF2 method (2) we first solve for $u_1$ using one step of BDF1 (backward Euler).

<pre class="mcode-input">dt = 0.01;                         % Time step
tfinal = 1;                        % Stopping time
nsteps = ceil(tfinal/dt);          % Number of time steps
m = 20;                            % Spatial discretization
alpha = 1/42;                      % Diffusion constant
up = u0;                           % Previous time step

% Do one step of backward Euler
K = sqrt(1/(dt*alpha))*1i;         % Helmholtz frequency for BDF1
u = spherefun.helmholtz(K^2*up, K, m, m);

K = sqrt(3/(2*dt*alpha))*1i;       % Helmholtz frequency for BDF2
for n = 2:nsteps
    rhs = K^2/3*(4*u - up);
    up = u;
    u = spherefun.helmholtz(rhs, K, m, m);

    % Plot the solution every 25 time steps
    if ( mod(n, 25) == 0 )
        plot( u ), colormap(flipud(hot)), caxis([-1 1.5])
        title(sprintf('Time %1.2f',n*dt)), colorbar, axis('off'), snapnow
    end
end</pre><img src="img/SphereHeatConduction_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

<img src="img/SphereHeatConduction_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

The difference between the true solution and the computed solution is

<pre class="mcode-input">utrue = exp(-42*alpha*tfinal)*u0;
norm(u-utrue)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     3.288443687653664e-05
</pre>The error here is dominated by temporal errors from the BDF2 method, as opposed to spatial discretization errors.



## 5. A more complicated example

In this second example we consider an initial condition for which there is no closed form solution.  We set the initial heat profile to a sum of Gaussian bumps:

<pre class="mcode-input">rng(10)
u0 = spherefun([]);
for bumps = 1:5
    x0 = 2*rand-1; y0 = sqrt(1-x0^2)*(2*rand-1); z0 = sqrt(1-x0^2-y0^2);
    u0 = u0 + spherefun(@(x,y,z) exp(-30*((x-x0).^2+(y-y0).^2+(z-z0).^2)));
end
plot(u0), colormap(flipud(hot)), colorbar, axis('off'), caxis([-0.05 1])</pre><img src="img/SphereHeatConduction_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

Since the sphere has no boundary, the total amount of heat is conserved: the mean of the solution at any time is equal to the mean of the the initial condition.  We repeat the code above with this new initial condition, but now also plot a contour that tracks the mean of the initial condition solution, which can be computed using the command `mean2`:

<pre class="mcode-input">meanu0 = mean2(u0);                % Mean of initial condition
dt = 0.01;                         % Time step
tfinal = 1;                        % Stopping time
nsteps = ceil(tfinal/dt);          % Number of time steps
m = 150;                           % Spatial discretization
alpha = 1/42;                      % Diffusion constant
up = u0;                           % Previous time step

% Do one step of backward Euler
K = sqrt(1/(dt*alpha))*1i;         % Helmholtz frequency for BDF1
u = spherefun.helmholtz(K^2*up, K, m, m);

K = sqrt(3/(2*dt*alpha))*1i;       % Helmholtz frequency for BDF2
for n = 2:nsteps
    rhs = K^2/3*(4*u - up);
    up = u;
    u = spherefun.helmholtz(rhs, K, m, m);   % Helmholtz solve

    % Plot the solution every 25 time steps
    if ( mod(n, 25) == 0 )
        plot( u ), colormap(flipud(hot)), caxis([-0.05 1]), hold on
        contour(u,[meanu0 meanu0],'b-'), hold off
        title(sprintf('Time %1.2f',n*dt)), colorbar, axis('off'), snapnow
    end
end</pre><img src="img/SphereHeatConduction_07.png" class="figure" alt="">

The numerical scheme preserves the mean value property to machine precision:

<pre class="mcode-input">norm(meanu0 - mean2(u))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.407796184655808e-15
</pre>

## 6. Future

In the future we hope to extend the technology of the new `spin2` command in Chebfun, which is based on exponential integrators for stiff PDEs, to Spherefun.  This has the potential to allow problems like the heat equation to be solved much more efficiently and accurately in time.
