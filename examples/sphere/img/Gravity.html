## 1. A little geometry

Here's a vector $X$ with 2-norm 1.5, which we will think of as a spacecraft in orbit around the unit sphere:

<pre class="mcode-input">X = [-1  -1.1, -.2];
norm(X)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.500000000000000
</pre>Let's use the vector-valued part of Spherefun to define the field of vector distances between $X$ and points on the sphere and $X$:

<pre class="mcode-input">d = spherefunv(@(x,y,z) X(1)-x, @(x,y,z) X(2)-y, @(x,y,z) X(3)-z);</pre>Here is the scalar function representing $|d|$, that is, the the scalar distance between $X$ and points on the sphere:

<pre class="mcode-input">r = sqrt(dot(d,d));</pre>We confirm that the closest point on the sphere to $X$ is at distance $0.5$:

<pre class="mcode-input">min_distance = min2(r)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">min_distance =
   0.500000000000014
</pre>Similarly, the farthest point is at distance $2.5$:

<pre class="mcode-input">max_distance = max2(r)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">max_distance =
   2.499999999999999
</pre>Here is a contour plot of $r$ on the sphere, together with a red dot showing our little spacecraft.

<pre class="mcode-input">contour(r,.6:.1:2,'k')
hold on, plot3(X(1),X(2),X(3),'.r','markersize',25), hold off
view(-10,35), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/Gravity_01.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 2. Inverse-square force

A great discovery of Newton (or was it Hooke?) is that the gravitational forces associated with a sphere of uniform mass distribution are the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center. Accordingly, we know that if a unit mass is spread around the sphere and the spacecraft also has unit mass, then the inverse-square attraction between them should be $(1.5)^{-2}$:

<pre class="mcode-input">force_exact = 1/1.5^2</pre><pre class="mcode-output">force_exact =
   0.444444444444444
</pre>Let's confirm this prediction by computing the integral over the sphere. Since the area of the sphere is $4\pi$, the density of a uniformly distributed mass is

<pre class="mcode-input">rho = 1/(4*pi)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">rho =
   0.079577471545948
</pre>That gives us the following component of the force at each point, in the direction of $X$:

<pre class="mcode-input">Xnormalized = X/norm(X);
force_function = rho*(Xnormalized*d)./r.^3;</pre>Summing, we get the expected answer:

<pre class="mcode-input">force = sum2(force_function)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">force =
   0.444444444444444
</pre>
