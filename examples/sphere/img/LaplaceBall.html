## 1.  The Laplace problem

Suppose we are given a function $h(x,y,z)$ on the unit sphere $S$ and we want to solve the Laplace equation in the unit ball $B$ with $h$ as boundary data, $$ \Delta u = 0, \quad u = h \hbox{ on } S. $$ Here we illustrate how this might be done in Ballfun.

Given the tools available, the boundary data will have to be reasonably smooth.  Let us choose a smooth random function with characteristic wavelength $\lambda = 0.2$.

<pre class="mcode-input">rng(1)
lambda = 0.2;
h = randnfunsphere(lambda);
plot(h), axis off, colorbar, caxis([-2 2])</pre><img src="img/LaplaceBall_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

You can call spherefun with three arguments, which are interpreted as cartesian coordinates $x,y,z$:

<pre class="mcode-input">h(1,0,0)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  -0.761180229121337
</pre>Alternatively, you can call it with two arguments, which are interpreted as longitude and polar angles (the latter measured down from the north pole):

<pre class="mcode-input">h(0,pi/2)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  -0.761180229121337
</pre>The mean of $h$ is small but nonzero:

<pre class="mcode-input">meanh = mean2(h)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">meanh =
  -0.020281680162226
</pre>

## 2. Solution with the `poisson` command

In Ballfun, there is a command `poisson` to solve the Poisson equation, which becomes the Laplace equation if we take the right-hand side to be zero. For this command, you need to specify a grid parameter $m$, which will need to grow in proportion to $1/\lambda$ if we want an accurate solution.  We haven't investigated the proportionality constant and will take one arbitrarily that appears to work:

<pre class="mcode-input">m = round(20/lambda);
zero = ballfun(0);
u = poisson(zero,h,m);</pre>Here, using cartesian coordinates, we confirm that $u$ matches the boundary data at the point $(1,0,0)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">h(1,0,0)
u(1,0,0)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  -0.761180229121337
ans =
  -0.761180229121337
</pre>Here, using spherical coordinates, we confirm that it matches the boundary data at the longitude and latitude coordinates of Oxford.

<pre class="mcode-input">long = -1.26*pi/180; lat = 51.75*pi/180;
h(long, pi/2-lat)
u(1, long, pi/2-lat,'spherical')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  -1.847977702024471
ans =
  -1.847977702024461
</pre>Another check we can carry out concerns mean values. The value of $u$ at the origin should equal the mean of the boundary data:

<pre class="mcode-input">meanh
u(0,0,0)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">meanh =
  -0.020281680162226
ans =
  -0.020281680162014
</pre>

## 3. The solution on an inner sphere

Since the Laplace equation is a smoothing operation, the solution $u$ is not very exciting in the interior.  For example, if we simply plot $u$, the image shows an apparently uniform color in the inner sphere of radius $1/2$:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(u)</pre><img src="img/LaplaceBall_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

We can construct a spherefun corresponding to the values of $u$ on this sphere of radius $0.5$ and plot it:

<pre class="mcode-input">uinner = u(.5,:,:,'spherical');
plot(uinner), colorbar</pre><img src="img/LaplaceBall_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Note the small range of values revealed in the colorbar.  The mean value over this sphere is our familiar value:

<pre class="mcode-input">meanh
mean2(uinner)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">meanh =
  -0.020281680162226
ans =
  -0.020281680162193
</pre>
