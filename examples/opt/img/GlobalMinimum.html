## The SIAM 100-Dollar, 100-Digit Challenge

In February 2002, an article in SIAM News by Nick Trefethen set a challenge to solve ten problems each to ten digits of precision (the solution of each problem was a real number) [1].  One of the problems was to find the global minimum of this complicated function.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = @(x,y) exp(sin(50*x)) + sin(60*exp(y)) + sin(70*sin(x)) +...
    sin(sin(80*y)) - sin(10*(x+y)) + (x.^2+y.^2)./4;
x = linspace(-1,1);
[xx, yy] = meshgrid(x);
surf(xx, yy, f(xx,yy)),

Since the term $(x^2+y^2)/4$ grows away from $(0,0)$ while the other terms remain bounded, it can be shown that the global minimum occurs in $[-1,1]^2$ [2].

The function is complicated and oscillatory, but of rank $4$, as can be seen by rearranging its terms and using the identity $\sin(a+b) = \sin(a)\cos(b) + \cos(a)\sin(b)$.

<pre class="mcode-input">g = chebfun2(f);
fprintf('Rank of function = %u\n', rank(g))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Rank of function = 4
</pre>For details about what we mean by the rank of a function see [3]. The minimum was found in [2] to 10,000 digits, and here are the first 16:

<pre class="mcode-input">exact = -3.306868647475237;</pre>We can compute this minimum using Chebfun2. The minimum is correct to 13 digits.

<pre class="mcode-input">Y = min2(g); fprintf('Computed global minimum = %1.16f\n', Y)
fprintf('Error in Chebfun2 minimum = %1.4e\n', abs(Y(1) -exact))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Computed global minimum = -3.3068686474747913
Error in Chebfun2 minimum = 4.4587e-13
</pre>Here is the full four-line code and how long it takes:

<pre class="mcode-input">s = tic;
f = @(x,y) exp(sin(50*x)) + sin(60*exp(y)) + sin(70*sin(x)) + sin(sin(80*y)) -...
    sin(10*(x+y)) + (x.^2+y.^2)./4;
g = chebfun2(f);
[Y, X] = min2(g);
t = toc(s);

fprintf('Total time taken = %1.4fs\n',t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Total time taken = 0.2693s
</pre>Here is the plot of the minimum in a contour plot:

<pre class="mcode-input">contour(g), hold on, plot(X(1), X(2), '.k', 'markersize', 14), hold off</pre><img src="img/GlobalMinimum_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

To see that the computed point is the global minimum we make the following plot:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(g), hold on, plot3(X(1),X(2),Y,'.k','markersize',20)
zlim([-10 10]), view(-24.5,4)</pre><img src="img/GlobalMinimum_03.png" class="figure" alt="">
