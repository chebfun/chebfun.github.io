% Chebfun's $\verb|trigremez|$ command can be used to find best
% (i.e. infinity-norm or minimax) trigonometric polynomial 
% approximations of a real-valued continuous function on a
% periodic interval. For example, here is a periodic function 
% on $[-\pi, \pi]$ and its best approximation by a 
% trigonometric polynomial of degree $5$:

f = chebfun(@(x) exp(sin(2*x)+cos(3*x)), [-pi, pi], 'trig');
[p,err] = trigremez(f,5);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; fs = 14;
plot(f,'k',p,'r',LW,1.6)

%%
% The error equioscillates, and the number of equioscillating
% extreme points is at least one more than the dimension
% of the approximation space. In the 
% present case of a degree $5$ trigonometric
% approximation, the dimension of the approximation
% space is $11$, and hence the error curve must have at 
% least 12 points of equioscillation: 
plot(f-p,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-pi pi], err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-pi pi],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim(5*err*[-1, 1]), hold off

% The $\verb|trigremez|$ command works for any chebfun, even 
% a chebfun that is constructed without the `trig` flag, as
% long as it is continuous in the interior of the domain 
% and takes the same value at both endpoints. Here is an example:
fh = @(x) 10*abs(x) + sin(20*pi*x) + 10*exp(-50*(x-.1).^2); 
f = chebfun(fh, 'splitting', 'on' );

%%
[p, err] = trigremez(f, 8);
plot(f,'k',p,'r',LW,1.6)
title('Function (black) and best trigonometric approximation (red)',FS,fs)

%%
% And here is a plot of the error curve:
plot(f-p,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-pi pi], err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-pi pi],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim(5*err*[-1 1]), hold off
title('Degree 8 trigonometric error curve',FS,fs)

%%
% Here is another example where we first define 
% a zig-zag function, which is aperiodic, but then
% make it periodic by subtracting off an appropriate linear
% term:
x = chebfun('x');
g = cumsum(sign(sin(20*exp(x))));
m = (g(1) - g(-1))/2;
y = m*(x - 1) + g(1);
f = g - y;
[p, err] = trigremez(f, 15);
plot(f,'k',p,'r',LW,1.6)

%%
% Again, the error plot equioscillates beautifully:
plot(f-p,LW,1.6), hold on
plot([-1 1], err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
plot([-1 1],-err*[1 1],'--k',LW,1)
ylim(5*err*[-1 1]), hold off

% Experienced best approximators are used to seeing error curves that 
% look approximately like Chebyshev polynomials, and indeed, there are 
% theorems to the
% effect that for functions satisfying appropriate smoothness
% conditions, the best polynomial approximation error curves
% approach Chebyshev polynomials as the degree approaches
% infinity.  In trigonometric rather than algebraic best
% approximation, however, the error curves tend to look like
% sine waves, not Chebyshev polynomials.  To the experienced
% eye, this can be quite a surprise. The following example illustrates
% this:
f = chebfun('1./(1.01-cos(x))',[-pi,pi],'trig');
plot(f-trigremez(f,40)), ylim([-1 1])

% The flavor of $\verb|trigremez|$ and the periodic 
% Remez algorithm that it utilizes could not be 
% more classical. Nevertheless, we are unaware of any 
% previous computations of general periodic best 
% approximations. Electrical engineers compute
% approximations all the time that appear to be 
% periodic---the Parks-McClellan algorithm---but
% because of a symmetry, these computations are 
% carried out using the ordinary polynomial 
% Remez algorithm.
