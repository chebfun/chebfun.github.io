% The Fourier series of a function $u \in L^{2}[-\pi,\pi]$ is given as
%
% $$ \mathcal{F}[u] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{ikx} $$
%
% where 
%
% $$ c_k = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)e^{-ikx} dx. $$
%
% Alternatively, we can express the series in terms of sines and cosines:
%
% $$ \mathcal{F}[u] = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_k \cos(k x) +
% \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} b_k \sin(k x) $$
%
% where 
%
% $$ a_k = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\cos(kx) dx, \quad
% b_k = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x)\sin(kx) dx, $$
%
% for $k>0$ and
%
% $$ a_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(x) dx. $$

%%
% Similar expressions hold for more general intervals $[a,b]$ by shifting
% and scaling appropriately.
%
% The Fourier coefficients for many functions $u$ can be computed in Chebfun using the
% `trigcoeffs` command. The smoothness of $u$ over $[-\pi,\pi]$ dictates
% the technique for determining the coefficients.

%% Smooth periodic functions
% Typically, if $u$ and its periodic extension are twice continuously
% differentiable over $[-\pi,\pi]$ and $u'''(x)$ is piecewise continuous
% on $[-\pi,\pi]$ (or more specifically of bounded variation) then the
% Fourier coefficients of $u$ can be quickly computed by first constructing
% $u$ with the `'trig'` flag in the Chebfun, then calling `trigcoeffs`.
% Here is an example for a simple Fourier polynomial:
u = chebfun(@(x) 1 - 4*cos(x) + 6*sin(2*x),[-pi,pi],'trig');
c = trigcoeffs(u);
disp('Fourier coeffs of 1 + cos(x) + sin(2*x):')
c

%%
% Note that `trigcoeffs` follows the MATLAB convention of having the 
% coefficients appear in order from highest degree to lowest degree. In the
% code above we have reversed this order to match the way the coefficients
% appear in the definitions above.
%
% Also note that `trigcoeffs` by default returns the coefficients in
% complex exponential form, i.e., the value of $c_k$ above.  The 
% equivalent coefficients in terms of cosines and sines can be obtained as:
[a,b] = trigcoeffs(u);
disp('Fourier cosine coeffs of 1 + cos(x) + sin(2*x)')
a
disp('Fourier sine coeffs of 1 + cos(x) + sin(2*x)')
b

%%
% Note that `a` contains the constant term in the series as its first
% coefficient followed by the coefficients for $\cos(x)$ and $\cos(2x)$, 
% while `b` starts with the coefficient for $\sin(x)$ followed by the 
% coefficient for $\sin(2x)$.

%%
% The default behavior of `trigcoeffs` is to return all the Fourier
% coefficients necessary to resolve the function to machine precision
% (assuming this number is less than 65537).  However, a specific number
% can be obtained with an additional input argument.  We illustrate this
% feature on the function $f(x) = 3/(5 - 4\cos(x))$, which is analytic in a 
% strip in the complex plane and has exact Fourier coefficients given by
% $c_k = 2^{-|k|}$:
numCoeffs = 11;
u = chebfun(@(x) 3./(5 - 4*cos(x)),[-pi,pi],'trig');
c = trigcoeffs(u,numCoeffs);
disp('Fourier coeffs of 3/(5-4cos(x)):')
c

%%
% We see that the computed results match the exact results to machine precision.

%%
% Here is an example for a less smooth function:
numCoeffs = 17;
u = chebfun(@(x) abs(sin(x)).^3,[-pi,pi],'trig');
c = trigcoeffs(u,numCoeffs); c = c(end:-1:1);
disp('Fourier coeffs of |sin(x)|^3')
c

%%
% We see that the coefficients decay much more slowly in this case
% in fact the number of terms required to resolve this function to machine
% precision is:
length(u)

%%
% The reason is that this function has only two continuous derivatives in
% $L^{2}[-\pi,\pi]$ and a piecewise continuous third derivative, so its
% Fourier coefficients decay as $O(|k|^{-4})$ [1].  This decay rate 
% can be seen by plotting the Fourier coefficients on a log-log scale, 
% which can be easily done for the positive mode coefficients (i.e. $k>0$)
% using the `plotcoeffs` command:
plotcoeffs(u,'loglog'), ylim([1e-15 1]), hold on
k = [100 length(u)/2];
plot(k,10*k.^(-4),'k-',LW,lw)
text(500,50*(500)^(-4),'O(k^{-4})','FontSize',12)
hold off

%% Non-smooth functions
% The Fourier coefficients of functions (and their periodic extensions) 
% with fewer than two continuous derivatives can also be computed.  However,
% the functions must first be constructed using the default, 'non-periodic',
% option.  In this case the Fourier coefficients are computed using the
% integral formulas (via Chebfun's `sum` method) instead of the Fast 
% Fourier Transform.
%
% The quintessential example of a non-smooth function is that of the square
% wave (or periodic extension of the step function), which can be defined
% by the `sign` function as
%
% $$ u(x) = \mbox{sign}(\sin(x)) $$ 
%
% This can be constructed in Chebfun with 'splitting' turned on,
sq_wave = @(x) sign(sin((x)));
u = chebfun(sq_wave,[-pi,pi],'splitting','on');

%%
% We can obtain the Fourier coefficients of this function using again the
% `trigcoeffs` method.  Since the square wave is odd, it makes sense to
% look at the Fourier sine coefficients in this case:
numCoeffs = 15;
[a,b] = trigcoeffs(u,numCoeffs);
disp('Fourier sine coeffs of unit step function:')
b

%%
% The exact values of the coefficients are 
%
% $$ b_k = \frac{4}{k\pi} ~~(k \mbox{ odd}) $$
%
% with $b_k = 0$ for $k$ even, $k\ge 1$.
% These values can be easily seen in the computed results:
disp('            k               pi/4*b_k')
disp([(1:7)' pi/4*real(b)])

%%
% The computed cosine coefficients are numerically zero, as expected:
norm(a,inf)

%%  Truncated Fourier approximations
% The `trigcoeffs` function can also be used in combination with the
% Chebfun constructor to generate truncated Fourier series representations
% of functions.  Here's an example for the above square wave using 15
% Fourier modes:
numModes = 15;
c = trigcoeffs(u,2*numModes+1);
u_trunc = chebfun(c,[-pi,pi],'trig','coeffs');
plot(u,'k-',u_trunc,'b-',LW,lw)

%%
% This represents the best 15-mode trigonometric approximation to the square
% wave over $[-\pi,\pi]$ in the $L^2$ sense. The oscillations in the
% approximation are called the Gibbs phenomenon.

%%
% To see the actual 'wave' it is useful to plot the approximation over 
% a larger interval, which can be done for $-4\pi \leq x \leq 4\pi$ as follows:
u = chebfun(sq_wave,[-4*pi,4*pi],'splitting','on');
u_trunc = chebfun(u_trunc,[-4*pi,4*pi],'trig');
plot(u,'k-',u_trunc,'b-',LW,lw)

%%
% Note that in this case we don't recompute the Fourier coefficients over
% the larger domain, we simply construct `u_trunc` over the larger domain.

%%
% Here is one last example for the sawtooth wave,
% again computed over $[-\pi,\pi]$
% then expanded to a larger domain:
sawtooth = @(x) (mod(x+pi,2*pi))/(2*pi);
u = chebfun(sawtooth,[-pi,pi],'splitting','on');
c = trigcoeffs(u,2*numModes+1);
u_trunc = chebfun(c,[-pi,pi],'trig','coeffs');

u = chebfun(sawtooth,[-4*pi,4*pi],'splitting','on');
u_trunc = chebfun(u_trunc,[-4*pi,4*pi],'trig');
plot(u,'k-',u_trunc,'b-',LW,lw)

%%
% To hear this wave using try `chebtune(u_trunc,6)`.
