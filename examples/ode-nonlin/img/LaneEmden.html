## Introduction

The well-known Lane-Emden equation models the mechanical structure of self-gravitating spheres. In astrophysics it plays an important role as it serves to model the structure of stars, ranging from white dwarfs to red giants. The equation is given by

<pre class="mcode">  x*u'' + 2*u' + x*u^n = 0,   u'(0) = 0,    u(0) = 1</pre>where u is the solution (known as a polytrope) which models the density of the gas cloud. The variable x corresponds to the radial distance from the centre. The gas is assumed to be polytropic with index n, that is pressure = C*density^(1+1/n) where C is a constant.



## Integer polytropic index

Below we compute the polytropes for index n = 0:5

<pre class="mcode-input">%n = Characteristic exponent
for n = 0:5
    % Assign the L-E operator on that domain.
    N = chebop(@(x,u) x*diff(u,2) + 2*diff(u) + x*u^n, [0,10]);

    % Left boundary conditions
    N.lbc = @(u) [u-1 ; diff(u)];

    % Solve the bvp
    u = solvebvp(N, 0);

    % Create plot of the solutions
    plot(u, 'Linewidth', 2), hold on,
    axis([0 10 -1 1]),

    xlabel('x'), ylabel('u')
end
hold off

Analytic solutions exist when n = 0, 1 and 5. So we can check the numerical error in these cases. We just do n = 5:

Analytic solution from [3]:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(@(x) 1./sqrt(1+x.^2/3), [0,10]);</pre>Compute the L2 error

<pre class="mcode-input">fprintf('The L2 error is: %1.3e\n', norm(f-u));</pre><pre class="mcode-output">The L2 error is: 4.421e-12
</pre>

## Finding the polytropic radius

Physically, the first root of the solution is of interest as it defines the outer boundary of the sphere where the gas cloud is polytropic. Since the magnitude of the radius is not known a priori, it can be introduced as an unknown function v; the independent variable can then be transformed as x -&gt; x/v.

As an example we choose the polytropic index to be n = 1.5, appropriate to model the structure of a white dwarf.

<pre class="mcode-input">warning('off', 'CHEBFUN:SINGFUN:plus:exponentDiff')

d = [0, 1];
x = chebfun('x', d);
N = chebop(d);
n = 1.5;
N.op  = @(x,u,v) x*diff(u,2) + 2*diff(u) + x*v^2*u^n;
N.lbc = @(u,v) [u-1 ; diff(u)];
N.rbc = @(u,v) u;
N.init = [cos(pi/2*x) ; pi];
uv = N\0;

warning('on', 'CHEBFUN:SINGFUN:plus:exponentDiff')
plot(uv, 'Linewidth', 2), hold on,
axis([0 1 0 1.05*uv{2}]),
title('Solution u and radius v'), legend('u','v')
xlabel('x'), ylabel('u')</pre><img src="img/LaneEmden_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Thus the radius of the polytrope describing the structure of a white dwarf is

<pre class="mcode-input">v = uv{2};
fprintf('Polytropic range for white dwarfs: [0,%1.12f)\n',v(1));</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Polytropic range for white dwarfs: [0,3.653753736220)
</pre>which agrees to all digits shown with the results given in [4].
