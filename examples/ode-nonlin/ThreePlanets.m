%%
% When three or more bodies interact gravitationally according
% to Newton's laws, the resulting orbits can be wonderfully
% complicated.  This example explores a special case
% in which the initial configuration has the three planets
% stationary at the positions of a 3-4-5 right
% triangle and the planets attract each other with pairwise $1/r^2$ forces.

%%
% To solve the problem, we use Chebfun's backslash command in
% the standard manner (which invokes the MATLAB `ode113` command
% to do the time-stepping).  Complex arithmetic is used for brevity.
% We solve the problem over a time interval of length 100, and 
% the solution reveals a beautiful property: the orbit is chaotic 
% for $t < t_c \approx 86$, but then at time $t = t_c$ the system 
% "self-ionizes".  After this point one planet goes off in one direction 
% and the other two go off as a pair in the opposite direction.  Such a
% thing could never happen with just two planets, but with three
% it is possible: energy and momentum are conserved.
% Thus this dynamical system illustrates the phenomenon
% of _transient chaos_.

%%
% This Example is modeled after the code `planets.m` in [1]. The
% second author first heard of the example from Oxford's
% astrophysicist James Binney.

%%
% To have some fun with this problem, it's nice to
% plot the configurations on a black background with a collection
% of "stars" at random locations.  The code `plotframe`
% does this.  Here is our initial condition:
x0 = 0; y0 = 3; z0 = 4i;
MS = 'markersize'; FS = 'fontsize';
plotframe(x0,y0,z0)
title('t = 0',FS,18)

%%
% Now we solve the problem to time $t=100$:
tmax = 100; dom = [0 tmax];
N = chebop(@planetfun, dom);
N.lbc = @(x,y,z) [x-x0; y-y0; z-z0; diff(x); diff(y); diff(z)];
[x,y,z] = N\0;

%%
% Here is a typical configuration for $t < t_c$:
t = 50;
plotframe(x(t),y(t),z(t))
title(['t = ' num2str(t) ],FS,18)

%%
% Here is how it looks at the critical moment:
t = 86;
plotframe(x(t),y(t),z(t))
title(['t = ' num2str(t) ],FS,18)

%%
% Of course, this problem really looks best in the form of
% movie!  To see the movie, you can execute this M-file.
% The final frame shows the system after it has split into
% two subsystems, drifting apart forever.
dt = .4; tmax = 100;
for t = 0:dt:tmax
    plotframe(x(t),y(t),z(t))
    title(sprintf('t = %3.0f',t),FS,18),
    drawnow, pause(0.1)
end
