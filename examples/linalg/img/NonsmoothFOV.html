## 1. A random matrix

Peter Maxwell from Trondheim gave a stimulating talk at last week's Strathclyde numerical analysis meeting about computing the boundary $c$ of the field of values [1].  Before we get to an intriguing $5\times 5$ matrix of his, let's look another more obvious example. Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with independent normally distributed entries from $N(0,/n)$, $n=60$, and let $c$ be the curve defining the boundary of its field of values (= numerical range):

<pre class="mcode-input">rng(1)
n = 60;
A = randn(n)/sqrt(n);
c = fov(A);</pre>$c$ is an analytic curve well separated from the eigenvalues of $A$, and it certainly looks smooth to the eye.

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(c,'linewidth',2), axis equal, xlim([-3 3]), grid on
hold on, plot(eig(A),'.k','markersize',8), hold off
title('field of values and eigenvalues')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Yet its length as a chebfun is very high.

<pre class="mcode-input">length(c)
plotcoeffs(c), grid on</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   803
</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

What's going on? How can a curve so smooth be so complicated? (A similar question is raised in a different context in Exercise 8.9 of _Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice_.)

Before going any further, let's convert to the more natural periodic form (Fourier instead of Chebyshev; see Chapter 11 of the _Chebfun Guide_).  This shortens the length of the chebfun, but only by a factor of only about $\pi/2$, so the puzzle persists of why the length is so high.

<pre class="mcode-input">c = chebfun(@(t) c(t),[0 2*pi],'trig');
length(c)
plotcoeffs(c), grid on
title('Fourier coefficients wrt Johnson angle t')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   563
</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The convergence of the Fourier coefficients is evidently geometric, confirming that $c$ is an analytic curve, as we expected (_ATAP_, chapter 8). But its strip of analyticity around the real axis in the complex plane is quite narrow.  We can show this by executing the `plotregion` command and superimposing also some estimates of poles near the real axis computed with `aaa`:

<pre class="mcode-input">plotregion(c), axis equal, grid on
xx = linspace(0,2*pi,1000);
[r,poles] = aaa(c(xx),xx,'tol',1e-10);
hold on, plot(poles,'.r'), hold off</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

Perhaps this is a bit highbrow.  A more straightforward way of seeing the nonsmoothness of $c$ is to plot the derivative of its absolute value:

<pre class="mcode-input">ac = abs(c);
plot(diff(ac)), grid on
xlabel('t')
ylabel('abs(c(t))''')
title('derivative of abs(c) wrt to Johnson angle t')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

Why does such a smooth-looking curve have such a complicated derivative?  A promising conjecture is that it is the parametrization of $c$ that is at fault.  This parametrization is in terms of the "Johnson angle" $t$ used in computing the field of values via extreme eigenvalues of the hermitian matrices $(B+B^*)/2$ with $B = e^{it} A$. Let us convert $c$ to a new parameterization in terms of a different variable that we hope will be better behaved, the angle $a$ of the curve from the origin.  We can do this by starting with a chebfun representation of $a(t)$.  Note that it's intriguingly wiggly.

<pre class="mcode-input">a = 2*pi + unwrap(angle(c));
plot(a), grid on
xlabel('Johnson angle t')
ylabel('true angle a')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

Now we want a new chebfun $d$ that represents $C$ as a function of $a$, in contrast to $c$ which represents it as a function of $t$.  We do this by means of the inverse function $t(a)$,

<pre class="mcode-input">t = inv(a);
d = chebfun(@(s) c(t(s)),[0 2*pi],'trig');</pre>As hoped, $d$ is simpler than before.

<pre class="mcode-input">plotcoeffs(d)
title('Fourier coefficients wrt true angle a')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_07.png" class="figure" alt="">

The derivative of its absolute value is better behaved.

<pre class="mcode-input">ad = abs(d);
plot(diff(ad)), grid on
xlabel('a')
ylabel('abs(d(a))''')
title('derivative of abs(d) wrt to true angle a')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_08.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 2. Peter Maxwell's $5\times 5$ matrix

We now repeat the above for a very interesting $5\times 5$ matrix cooked up by Maxwell.  Here the field of values has a section that is nearly straight:

<pre class="mcode-input">A = [
  0.2560 + 0.0573i   0.0568 + 0.0800i   0.1597 + 0.2204i  -0.1649 + 0.1315i  -0.3639 + 0.0091i;
  0.4733 + 0.2805i  -0.3192 + 0.1267i   0.0810 + 0.0687i   0.5213 + 0.1574i  -0.0596 + 0.2879i;
  0.1447 + 0.3037i   0.2942 + 0.1844i  -0.2918 + 0.0364i  -0.2714 + 0.0265i  -0.0849 + 0.2264i;
 -0.0650 + 0.1360i   0.0952 + 0.0813i  -0.0503 + 0.0920i  -0.1500 + 0.0814i   0.4742 + 0.1514i;
  0.1938 + 0.0344i   0.0419 + 0.1868i  -0.0453 + 0.0988i  -0.2207 + 0.2483i  -0.0772 + 0.1793i ];
c = fov(A);
plot(c,'linewidth',2), axis equal, xlim([-2 2]), grid on
hold on, plot(eig(A),'.k','markersize',8), hold off</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_09.png" class="figure" alt="">

The length is really enormous:

<pre class="mcode-input">length(c)
plotcoeffs(c), grid on</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
        5704
</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_10.png" class="figure" alt="">

Again we convert to trig form.

<pre class="mcode-input">c = chebfun(@(t) c(t),[0 2*pi],'trig');
length(c)
plotcoeffs(c), grid on</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
        3781
</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_11.png" class="figure" alt="">

The derivative of the absolute value is sharply localized near the special point.

<pre class="mcode-input">ac = abs(c);
plot(diff(ac)), grid on
xlabel('a')
ylabel('abs(d(a))''')
title('derivative of abs(d) wrt to true angle a')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_12.png" class="figure" alt="">

So is the relationship $a(t)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">a = 2*pi + unwrap(angle(c));
a = chebfun(@(s) a(s),[0 2*pi]);
plot(a), grid on
xlabel('Johnson angle t')
ylabel('true angle a')</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_13.png" class="figure" alt="">

As hoped, $d$ is much simpler than $c$.

<pre class="mcode-input">t = inv(a);
d = chebfun(@(s) c(t(s)),t.ends([1 end]),'trig');
plotcoeffs(d)</pre><img src="img/NonsmoothFOV_14.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 3. Eigenvalue avoided crossings

Maxwell has pointed out (private communication) that these effects are related in a very interesting way to eigenvalue avoided crossings.  For all values of the Johnson angle $t$, the eigenvalues of the matrix $(B+B^*)/2$ mentioned above are real and distinct, but for some values of $t$ they come very close together, and this has a good deal to do with the complexity of $c$ and $d$.  See the Chebfun linear algebra examples "Eigenvalue level repulsion" and "Analyticity at eigenvalue near-crossings".
