The classic finite-difference 1D Laplacian discretization looks like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">N = 11;
A = toeplitz([2 -1 zeros(1,N-3)])</pre><pre class="mcode-output">A =
     2    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
    -1     2    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0    -1     2    -1     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0    -1     2    -1     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0    -1     2    -1     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0    -1     2    -1     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0    -1     2    -1     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0    -1     2    -1     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0    -1     2    -1
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0    -1     2
</pre>We may split $A$ into its lower-triangular, diagonal, and upper-triangular parts:

<pre class="mcode-input">L = tril(A,-1);
D = diag(diag(A));
U = triu(A,1);</pre>From the beginning of the computer era, people studied solution of matrix problems with this kind of matrix by the method of _successive overrelaxation_ or _SOR_.  Here $\omega\in [1,2]$ is the overrelaxation parameter, and we iterate with the matrix defined like this: $$ G = M^{-1} N, \qquad M = D + \omega L, \quad N = (1-\omega)D- \omega U. $$ In MATLAB, that's

<pre class="mcode-input">G = @(om) (D+om*L)\((1-om)*D-om*U);
rho = @(om) max(abs(eig(G(om))));</pre>Analysis of the SOR iteration was carried out by Frankel [1] and generalized by Young [4]; see also [3].  Details are given in innumerable books, such as Golub and Van Loan [2]. Supposing we didn't know the theory, Chebfun would give us an elegant way to draw the famous optimal-$\omega$ curve:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(rho,[1 2],'splitting','on');
plot(f), grid on
xlabel('\omega')
ylabel('convergence factor')</pre><img src="img/SOR_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Chebfun gives us the following optimal omega:

<pre class="mcode-input">[rho_opt,omega_opt] = min(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">rho_opt =
   0.560387921274775
omega_opt =
   1.560387921274774
</pre>Here are the exact optimal values:

<pre class="mcode-input">omega_exact = 2/(1+sin(pi/N))
rho_exact = omega_exact - 1</pre><pre class="mcode-output">omega_exact =
   1.560387921274774
rho_exact =
   0.560387921274774
</pre>
