For a couple of years Chebfun has had a command `conformal` for computing a conformal map of a smooth simply connected region onto the unit disk, and now there is a companion command `conformal2` for mapping a smooth doubly-connected region onto a circular annulus.  The conformal modulus, which is the ratio of the inner to outer radii of the annulus, is determined in the process.

For example, here we map a region $\Omega$ bounded by two ellipses to the annulus $A_\rho$ with $\rho \approx 0.409705$.

<pre class="mcode-input">circle = chebfun('exp(1i*pi*t)','trig');
ellipse = real(circle) + .6i*imag(circle);
C1 = 3*ellipse - 1; C2 = exp(.5i)*ellipse;
tic, [f, finv, rho] = conformal2(C1,C2,'plots'); toc
rho</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 2.781155 seconds.
rho =
   0.409705344001635
</pre><img src="img/ConformalMapping2_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here we do it again but to 12-digit accuracy instead of the default 6 digits:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic, [f, finv, rho] = conformal2(C1,C2,'plots','tol',1e-12); toc
rho</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 9.381164 seconds.
rho =
   0.409705344001634
</pre><img src="img/ConformalMapping2_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

As with the simply-connected `conformal`, the red dots show poles associated with the numerical representations of these maps. The objects `f` and `finv` are function handles corresponding to AAA rational approximations of the maps from $\Omega$ to $A_\rho$ and from $A_\rho$ to $\Omega$, respectively. The accuracy in much of the domain is actually better than 12 digits, as we verify by mapping the points $1, i$ back and forth:

<pre class="mcode-input">z = [1 1i];
finv(f(z))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  Column 1
  1.000000000000039 - 0.000000000000014i
  Column 2
  0.000000000000007 + 0.999999999999993i
</pre>These rational representations are fantastically efficient.  We can map a million points back and forth in 1 second.

<pre class="mcode-input">z = 1 + .1*rand(1e6,1) + .1i*rand(1e6,1);
tic, finv(f(z)); toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 0.835162 seconds.
</pre>Here is a wigglier example.

<pre class="mcode-input">circle = chebfun('exp(1i*pi*t)','trig');
C1 = circle*chebfun('2+.1*cos(8*pi*t)','trig');
C2 = circle*chebfun('1+.1*cos(5*pi*t)','trig');
tic, [f, finv, rho] = conformal2(C1,C2,'plots'); toc
rho</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 3.361993 seconds.
rho =
   0.515907564661642
</pre><img src="img/ConformalMapping2_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here is a "hyperellipse" enclosing a disk.  Note how we define the hyperellipse via a level curve of a chebfun2.

<pre class="mcode-input">F = chebfun2(@(x,y) x.^8 + y.^8);
C1 = roots(F-.5); C2 = .5*circle;
tic, [f, finv, rho] = conformal2(C1,C2,'plots'); toc
rho</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Elapsed time is 1.833265 seconds.
rho =
   0.506114112297564

The algorithm used by `conformal2` consists of solving a Laplace problem (computing a Green's function) by Laurent expansion with least-squares collocation on the boundary, as described in [2]. A key part of this is the use of Vandermonde with Arnoldi orthogonalization [1], which is available with the Chebfun commands `VAorthog` and `VAeval`.  (The latter is actually not needed for this application because the AAA rational functions do the evaluation instead.)

Both `conformal` and `conformal2` are restricted in their applicability to smooth domains.  As described in [2], related algorithms have been developed for regions with corners, but these are not currently available in Chebfun.
