In MATLAB, a standard command for least-squares fitting by a polynomial to a set of discrete data points is `polyfit`.  The polynomial returned by `polyfit` is represented in MATLAB's usual manner by a vector of coefficients in the monomial basis.

In Chebfun, there is an overloaded `polyfit` command in the domain class that does the same thing, except that the polynomial is returned as a chebfun rather than a coefficient vector. Here is an example:

<pre class="mcode-input">npts = 100;
x = linspace(-1,1,npts);
y = 1./(1+25*x.^2) + 1e-1*randn(1,npts);
f = polyfit(x,y,10,domain(-1,1));
plot(x,y,'xk','markersize',12)
hold on, plot(f,'r')

Chebfun also has a `polyfit` command in the chebfun class, and this is for continuous rather than discrete polynomial least-squares fitting.  For example, here is a least-squares fit to a jagged function:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun('abs(x+.2)-.5*sign(x-.5) ','splitting','on');
r = polyfit(f,10);
hold off, plot(f,'k',r,'r')
