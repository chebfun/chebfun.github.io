Every function defined on $[-1,1]$, so long as it is a little bit smooth (Lipschitz continuity is enough), has an absolutely and uniformly convergent Chebyshev series:

$$ f(x) = a_0 + a_1 T_1(x) + a_2 T_2(x) + \cdots . $$

The same holds on an interval $[a,b]$ with appropriately scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomials.

For many functions you can compute these coefficients with the command `chebcoeffs`.  For example, here we compute the Chebyshev coefficients of a cubic polynomial:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x');
format long
disp('Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:')
p = 99*x^2 + x^3;
a = chebcoeffs(p)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:
a =
  49.500000000000000
   0.750000000000000
  49.500000000000000
   0.250000000000000
</pre>Similarly, here are the Chebyshev coefficients down to level $10^{-15}$ of $\exp(x)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">disp('Cheb coeffs of exp(x):')
a = chebcoeffs(exp(x))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Cheb coeffs of exp(x):
a =
   1.266065877752008
   1.130318207984970
   0.271495339534077
   0.044336849848664
   0.005474240442094
   0.000542926311914
   0.000044977322954
   0.000003198436462
   0.000000199212481
   0.000000011036772
   0.000000000550590
   0.000000000024980
   0.000000000001039
   0.000000000000040
   0.000000000000001
</pre>You can plot the absolute values of these numbers on a log scale with `plotcoeffs`:

<pre class="mcode-input">plotcoeffs(exp(x)), grid on
xlabel('degree n')
ylabel('|a_n|'), ylim([1e-17 1e1])
title('Chebyshev coefficients of exp(x)')</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here's a similar plot for a function that needs thousands of terms to be represented to 15 digits.  (Can you explain why there are two lines of dots?)

<pre class="mcode-input">plotcoeffs(exp(x)/(1+10000*x^2)), grid on
xlabel('degree n'), ylabel('|a_n|')
ylim([1e-18 1])
title('Chebyshev coefficients of exp(x)/(1+10000x^2)')</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

These methods will work for any function $f$ that's represented by a global polynomial, i.e., a chebfun consisting of one fun.  What about Chebyshev coefficients for functions that are not smooth enough for such a representation?  Here one can use the `'trunc'` option in the Chebfun constructor. For example, suppose we are interested in the function

<pre class="mcode-input">f = sign(x);
figure, plot(f,'k','jumpline','-'), ylim([-1.5 1.5])
title('sign(x)')</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

If we try to compute all the Chebyshev coefficients, we'll get an error. On the other hand we can compute the first ten of them like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">p = chebfun(f,'trunc',10);
a = chebcoeffs(p)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">a =
  -0.000000000000000
   1.273239544735162
  -0.000000000000000
  -0.424413181578388
   0.000000000000000
   0.254647908947032
  -0.000000000000000
  -0.181891363533594
  -0.000000000000000
   0.141471060526130
</pre>Here's the degree 9 polynomial obtained by adding up these first terms of the Chebyshev expansion:

<pre class="mcode-input">hold on
plot(p,'m')
title('sign(x) and truncated Chebyshev series')</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

This is not the same as the degree 9 polynomial interpolant through 10 Chebyshev points, but they are close.  See Chapters 4, 7, and 8 of [1].

<pre class="mcode-input">pinterp = chebfun(f,10);
plot(pinterp)
title('Same, also with Chebyshev interpolant')</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_05.png" class="figure" alt="">
