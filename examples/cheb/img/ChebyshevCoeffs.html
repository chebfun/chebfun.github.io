Every function defined on $[-1,1]$, so long as it is a little bit smooth (Lipschitz continuity is enough), has an absolutely and uniformly convergent Chebyshev series:

$$ f(x) = a_0 + a_1 T_1(x) + a_2 T_2(x) + \cdots . $$

The same holds on an interval $[a,b]$ with appropriately scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomials.

For many functions you can compute these coefficients with the command `chebcoeffs`.  For example, here we compute the Chebyshev coefficients of a cubic polynomial:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x');
format long
disp('Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:')
p = 99*x.^2 + x.^3;
a = chebcoeffs(p)'</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:
a =
   0.250000000000000
  49.499999999999986
   0.750000000000000
  49.499999999999986
</pre>Notice that following the usual MATLAB convention, the coefficients appear in order from highest degree to lowest.  Thus it is often more useful to write

<pre class="mcode-input">disp('Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:')
a = chebcoeffs(p)'; a = a(end:-1:1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Cheb coeffs of 99x^2 + x^3:
a =
  49.499999999999986
   0.750000000000000
  49.499999999999986
   0.250000000000000
</pre>Similarly, here are the Chebyshev coefficients down to level $10^{-15}$ of $\exp(x)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">disp('Cheb coeffs of exp(x):')
a = chebcoeffs(exp(x))'; a = a(end:-1:1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Cheb coeffs of exp(x):
a =
   1.266065877752008
   1.130318207984970
   0.271495339534077
   0.044336849848664
   0.005474240442094
   0.000542926311914
   0.000044977322954
   0.000003198436462
   0.000000199212481
   0.000000011036772
   0.000000000550590

   0.000000000000040
   0.000000000000001
</pre>You can plot the absolute values of these numbers on a log scale with `plotcoeffs`:

<pre class="mcode-input">FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize'; LW = 'linewidth';
plotcoeffs(exp(x),'.-',LW,1,MS,20), grid on
xlabel('degree n',FS,14)
ylabel('|a_n|',FS,14)
title('Chebyshev coefficients of exp(x)',FS,14)</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here's a similar plot for a function that needs thousands of terms to be represented to 15 digits.  (Can you explain why it looks like a wide stripe?)

<pre class="mcode-input">plotcoeffs(exp(x)./(1+10000*x.^2)), grid on
xlabel('degree n',FS,12)
ylabel('|a_n|',FS,12)
title('Chebyshev coefficients of exp(x)/(1+10000x^2)',FS,16)</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

These methods will work for any function $f$ that's represented by a global polynomial, i.e., a chebfun consisting of one fun.  What about Chebyshev coefficients for functions that are not smooth enough for such a representation?  Here one can use the `trunc` option in the Chebfun constructor. For example, suppose we are interested in the function

<pre class="mcode-input">f = sign(x);
figure, plot(f,'k',LW,2), ylim([-1.5 1.5])
title('sign(x)',FS,16)</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

If we try to compute all the Chebyshev coefficients, we'll get an error. On the other hand we can compute the first ten of them like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">p = chebfun(f,'trunc',10);
a = chebcoeffs(p)'; a = a(end:-1:1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">a =
                   0
   1.273239544735162
  -0.000000000000000
  -0.424413181578388
   0.000000000000000
   0.254647908947032
   0.000000000000000
  -0.181891363533594
  -0.000000000000000
   0.141471060526130
</pre>Here's the degree 9 polynomial obtained by adding up these first terms of the Chebyshev expansion:

<pre class="mcode-input">hold on
plot(p,'m',LW,2)
title('sign(x) and truncated Chebyshev series',FS,16)</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

This is not the same as the degree 9 polynomial interpolant through 10 Chebyshev points:

<pre class="mcode-input">pinterp = chebfun(f,10);
plot(pinterp,'--','color',[0 .8 0],LW,2)
title('Same, also with Chebyshev interpolant',FS,16)</pre><img src="img/ChebyshevCoeffs_05.png" class="figure" alt="">
