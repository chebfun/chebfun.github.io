## 1. Introduction

Chebfun's `spin2` and `spinop2` codes include a number of preloaded examples. One of them is the 2D Swift-Hohenberg equation, which we can run by typing `spin2('sh2')`. It uses the following `spinop2` object:

<pre class="mcode-input">S = spinop2('sh2')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">S = 
  spinop2 with properties:

           domain: [0 20 0 20]
             init: [InfxInf chebfun2]
       linearPart: @(u)-2*lap(u)-biharm(u)
    nonlinearPart: @(u)-.9*u+u.^2-u.^3
            tspan: [0 200]
          numVars: 1
</pre>From here we see that the version of the equation in Chebfun is $$ u_t = ru - (1 + \Delta)^2u + gu^2 - u^3, $$ with $r = 0.1$ and $g=1$. This equation was derived by Swift and Hohenberg in 1977 to study thermal fluctuations on a fluid near the Rayleigh-B\'enard convective instability [1]. The function $u$ is the temperature field in a plane horizontal layer of fluid heated from below. The parameter $r$ measures how far the temperature is above the minimum temperature required for convection: for $r&lt;0$, the heating is too small to cause convection, while for $r&gt;0$, convection occurs. The parameter $g$ controls the strength of the quadratic nonlinearity. The Swift-Hohenberg equation is an example of a PDE that exhibits pattern formation, including stripes, spots and spirals. The preloaded demo starts with an initial condition of amplitude $0.1$ involving random noise on the domain $[0, 20, 0, 20]$, runs to $t=200$ and leads to a set of spots. As always, the boundary conditions are periodic.

<pre class="mcode-input">u = spin2('sh2', 'plot', 'off');
plot(u), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Note that we set `'plot'` to `'off'` to avoid the movie mode, which is the default. The output `u` is the solution at the final time $t=200$ and is a `chebfun2`:

<pre class="mcode-input">u</pre><pre class="mcode-output">u =
   chebfun2 object
       domain                 rank       corner values
[   0,  20] x [   0,  20]       41     [-0.19 -0.19 -0.19 -0.19]
vertical scale = 1.2 
</pre>We will discover what effect $r$ and $g$ have on the resulting patterns during our investigations below.



## 2. Spots, spirals and stripes

Let us construct a `spinop2` corresponding to $r=10^{-2}$ and $g=1$, on the domain $[0, 20\pi, 0, 20\pi]$ and with time interval $[0, 200]$:

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = [0 20*pi 0 20*pi];
tspan = [0 200];
S = spinop2(dom, tspan);
S.linearPart = @(u) -2*lap(u) - biharm(u);
r = 1e-2;
g = 1;
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) (-1 + r)*u + g*u.^2 - u.^3;</pre>Let us take an initial condition corresponding to the sum of a sine/cosine function and five Gaussian bumps:

<pre class="mcode-input">u0 = 1/20*chebfun2(@(x,y) cos(x) + sin(2*x) + sin(y) + cos(2*y), dom, 'trig');
u0 = u0 + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-((x-5*pi).^2 + (y-5*pi).^2)), dom, 'trig');
u0 = u0 + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-((x-5*pi).^2 + (y-15*pi).^2)), dom, 'trig');
u0 = u0 + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-((x-15*pi).^2 + (y-15*pi).^2)), dom, 'trig');
u0 = u0 + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-((x-15*pi).^2 + (y-5*pi).^2)), dom, 'trig');
u0 = u0 + chebfun2(@(x,y) exp(-((x-10*pi).^2 + (y-10*pi).^2)), dom, 'trig');
S.init = u0;</pre>The initial condition looks like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(S.init), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Let us run the simulation:

<pre class="mcode-input">u = spin2(S, 'plot', 'off', 'N', 100, 'dt', 2e-1);
plot(u), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Note that we use $N=100$ points in each direction and a time-step $dt=0.2$. The values $r=10^{-2}$ and $g=1$ lead to spots, known as convection cells. When the fluid is heated, it expands and becomes less dense. The colder, denser part of the fluid descends to settle below the warmer. This causes the warmer fluid to rise and generates this pattern. We can plot the Fourier coefficients of the solution with `plotcoeffs`:

<pre class="mcode-input">plotcoeffs(u)</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

The solution at the final time is well resolved. To check that the computation is correct, we can increase the number of grid points and decrese the time-step, and compute the relative error between the two solutions:

<pre class="mcode-input">v = spin2(S, 'plot', 'off', 'N', 120, 'dt', 1e-1);
error = norm(u-v)/norm(v);
fprintf('Relative error: %1.2e\n', error)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Relative error: 3.58e-04
</pre>This means that we have 3 digits correct. For the same value of $g=1$ but with $r=0.7$, we get spirals at the final time $t=200$:

<pre class="mcode-input">r = 7e-1; g = 1;
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) (-1 + r)*u + g*u.^2 - u.^3;
u = spin2(S, 'plot', 'off', 'N', 100, 'dt', 2e-1);
clf, plot(u), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

Finally, for $r=10^{-1}$, $g=0$, the solution as $t=200$ is a set of stripes:

<pre class="mcode-input">S.tspan = [0 200];
r = 1e-1; g = 0;
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) (-1 + r)*u + g*u.^2 - u.^3;
u = spin2(S, 'plot', 'off', 'N', 100, 'dt', 2e-1);
plot(u), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/SwiftHohenberg_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

This solution represents a set of convection rolls where each yellow stripe is the hot fluid coming up, and each blue stripe is the cold fluid going down.
