## 1. Preloaded examples in spin2

Chebfun's `spin2` and `spinop2` codes, like `spin` and `spinop` in 1D, include a number of preloaded examples, which you can find out about by typing `help spin2` or `help spinop2`. One of the options is `spin2('gl2')` for the 2D Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation.  What is this equation?

To find out, you can type

<pre class="mcode-input">S = spinop2('gl2')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">S = 
  spinop2 with properties:

           domain: [0 100 0 100]
             init: [InfxInf chebfun2]
       linearPart: @(u)lap(u)
    nonlinearPart: @(u)u-(1+1.5i)*u.*(abs(u).^2)
            tspan: [0 100]
          numVars: 1
</pre>From here we see that the version of the equation in Chebfun is $$ u_t = \Delta u + u - (1+1.5i)u |u|^2 . $$ Thus we have a scalar PDE involving a complex variable. This equation has been used by a number of authors in the study of chaotic processes arising in fluid mechanics and other areas [1,2].

Using the above as a model, let us set up our own complex Ginzburg-Landau calculation as follows.

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = 50*[-1 1 -1 1];
tspan = [0 16];
S = spinop2(dom,tspan);
S.linearPart = @(u) lap(u);
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) u - (1+1.5i)*u.*(abs(u).^2);</pre>

## 2. Non-chaotic solutions

For our first initial condition, suppose we take the complex function $$ u_0(x,y) = (ix+y) \exp(-0.03(x^2+y^2)). $$ We let 16 time units time elapse and find a pretty spiral:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x,dom); y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y,dom);
u1 = (1i*x+y).*exp(-.03*(x.^2+y.^2)); S.init = u1;
npts = 80; dt = 4/npts; tic
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_01.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Here is the analogous experiment with the real initial condition $$ u_0(x,y) = (x+y) \exp(-0.03(x^2+y^2)). $$

<pre class="mcode-input">u2 = (x+y).*exp(-.03*(x.^2+y.^2)); S.init = u2;
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_02.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Time for the first pair of computations:

<pre class="mcode-input">time_in_seconds = toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">time_in_seconds =
   5.629085000000000
</pre>

## 3. Beginnings of chaos

Spin computations always live on periodic domains.  We now extend these two computations to $t=48$, time enough for the function values to pass across the boundary and come in the other side.  Here is the first computation.

<pre class="mcode-input">tspan = [0 48];
S = spinop2(dom,tspan);
S.linearPart = @(u) lap(u);
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) u - (1+1.5i)*u.*(abs(u).^2);
S.init = u1; tic
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_03.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

The picture reveals the remnants of the spiral in the middle but some more complicated behavior in the corners.  Experiments on a finer mesh show that this picture is correct.  The structures have somewhat of a random appearance, but they are not random.

Now we run the second function to $t=48$.  This image is also correct.  Note the preservation of the diagonal line of symmetry.

<pre class="mcode-input">S.init = u2;
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_04.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Time for this second round of computations:

<pre class="mcode-input">time_in_seconds = toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">time_in_seconds =
   8.402740000000000
</pre>

## 4. Chaos

Let's go now to $t=96$. Experiments with different grids confirm that this first image is correct.

<pre class="mcode-input">tic, tspan = [0 96];
S = spinop2(dom,tspan);
S.linearPart = @(u) lap(u);
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) u - (1+1.5i)*u.*(abs(u).^2);
S.init = u1;
tic, u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_05.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

With the second function, we refine the grid enough to get a plausible picture, but it is not in fact converged. So this image is perhaps physically correct, but not mathematically correct.  Note that the symmetry line has been lost.

<pre class="mcode-input">npts = 128; dt = 4/npts; tic
S.init = u2;
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u)), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_06.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Time for the third round of computations:

<pre class="mcode-input">time_in_seconds = toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">time_in_seconds =
  18.065356000000001
</pre>

## 5. A bigger canvas

Let's double the size of the domain and the number of grid points in each direction.  Here's the solution at $t=30$.

<pre class="mcode-input">dom = 100*[-1 1 -1 1];
tspan = [0 30 60];
S = spinop2(dom,tspan);
S.linearPart = @(u) lap(u);
S.nonlinearPart = @(u) u - (1+1.5i)*u.*(abs(u).^2);
x = chebfun2(@(x,y) x,dom); y = chebfun2(@(x,y) y,dom);
u1 = (1i*(x-8)+(y-2)).*exp(-.03*((x-8).^2+(y-2).^2)) + ...
     ((x+8)-(y+2)).*exp(-.03*((x+8).^2+(y+2).^2));
S.init = u1;
npts = 128; dt = 8/npts; tic
u = spin2(S,'N',npts,'dt',dt,'plot','off');
plot(real(u{2})), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_07.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

And at $t=60$, of questionable accuracy:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(real(u{3})), view(0,90), axis equal, axis off</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_08.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

To close a psychedelic note here is a phase portrait, obtained by plotting $u$ rather than its real part.

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(u{3})</pre><img src="img/GinzburgLandau_09.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Time for the big canvas computation:

<pre class="mcode-input">time_in_seconds = toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">time_in_seconds =
   7.687864000000000
</pre>
