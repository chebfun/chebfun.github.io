Instead of a plot showing many function values, sometime we may wish to highlight just a plus/minus distinction.  For this there is the `'zebra'` option in Chebfun2, Spherefun, and Diskfun.

For example, here is zebra plot of a certain function on the disk. For fun we've changed the colors from the usual black/white.

<pre class="mcode-input">cheb.xydisk;
f = sin(20*(x+y).*(1+y));
plot(f, 'zebra')
colormap([1 1 0; 0 0 0])
axis off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Normally, however, the plots show zebras rather than bumblebees. Negative values are black and positive values are white. Here is an example on the sphere.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = spherefun.sphharm(15,5);
plot(f,'zebra')
axis off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here is an example on a rectangle.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = randnfun2(.2,[-2 2 -1 1]);
plot(f, 'zebra')
axis equal off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

It was hardly necessary to give Chebfun a zebra option, merely convenient and memorable. One can achieve the same effect same with the `contourf` command.  Here for example is a zebra plot using a brownish-orange color.  Maybe that makes it a giraffe plot.

<pre class="mcode-input">clf, contourf(f,[0 0])
colormap([.8 .4 .2; 0 0 0])
axis equal off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

Contouring commands like this are quick and designed for graphical accuracy.  If you want higher-accuracy resolution of boundaries (at least if they are not too complicated), you can use `roots`.

<pre class="mcode-input">c = roots(f);
plot(c), axis equal</pre><img src="img/Zebra_05.png" class="figure" alt="">
