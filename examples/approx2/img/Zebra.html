Instead of a plot showing many function values, we may prefer to show just a plus/minus distinction.  For this there is the `'zebra'` option in Chebfun2, Spherefun, and Diskfun.

For example, here is zebra plot of a certain function on the disk. For fun we've changed the colors from the usual black/white.

<pre class="mcode-input">cheb.xydisk;
f = sin(20*(x+y).*(1+y));
plot(f, 'zebra')
colormap([1 1 0; 0 0 0])
axis off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Normally, however, the plots show zebras rather than bumblebees. Negative values are black and positive values are white. Here is an example on the sphere.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = spherefun.sphharm(15,5);
plot(f,'zebra')
axis off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

And here is an example on the unit square.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = randnfun2(.1);
plot(f, 'zebra')
axis equal off</pre><img src="img/Zebra_03.png" class="figure" alt="">
