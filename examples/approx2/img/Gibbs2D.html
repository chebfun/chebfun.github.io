## 1. Chebyshev 2D Gibbs effect

Here is an illustration of the Gibbs phenomenon in 2D:

<pre class="mcode-input">A = zeros(100); A(40:61,40:61) = 1;
p = chebfun2(A); plot(p), zlim([-.2 1.5]), view(-20,50)</pre><img src="img/Gibbs2D_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

What's going on is that Chebfun has constructed a bivariate polynomial interpolant $p(x,y)$ to data at $100^2$ 2D Chebshev points, zero on most of the domain and 1 on a square in the middle.

How big is the overshoot?

<pre class="mcode-input">max2(p)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.320316254042390
</pre>This is big! -- about twice what we are used to with a 1D Gibbs effect:

<pre class="mcode-input">a = zeros(100,1); a(40:61) = 1;
p1 = chebfun(a); max(p1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.149050152970874
</pre>(In the limit of an infinite grid this would converge to $1.14114\dots;$ see equation (9.1) of [1].) The reason is that the overshoot at the corner is especially large, as we can see by zooming in:

<pre class="mcode-input">pzoom = p{0,.5,0,.5}; plot(pzoom), zlim([-.2 1.5]), view(-30,15)</pre><img src="img/Gibbs2D_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The undershoot, by contrast, is of a more usual size:

<pre class="mcode-input">min2(p)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
  -0.153785123606236
</pre>

## 2. Fourier 2D Gibbs effect

A Fourier analogue can be produced by including the 'periodic' flag:

<pre class="mcode-input">t = chebfun2(A,'periodic'); plot(t), view(-20,50)</pre><img src="img/Gibbs2D_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The extrema are similar:

<pre class="mcode-input">max2(t), min2(t)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.316297664943330
ans =
  -0.155566549488912
</pre>
