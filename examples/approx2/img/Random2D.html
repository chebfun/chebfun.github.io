Recently Chebfun added the command `randnfun` for generating smooth random functions in 1D as well as the periodic `randfuntrig`. In keeping with Chebfun's mission of realizing continuous analogues of the discrete objects of Matlab, `randnfun` can be regarded as a continuous analogue of `randn`. Chebfun can construct 2D random functions too, with `randnfun2` and `randnfun2trig`.  Random functions in 3D or on the sphere or the disk have not yet been implemented.

A technical paper has not yete been written describing these functions, but in a word, the idea is that a ``smooth random function'' is constructed from a finite Fourier series with independent normally distributed random coefficients. A parameter `dt` must be specified that specifies the associated space scale.  Approximately speaking, a random function contains wave numbers up to about $2\pi/dt$..

To illustrate, here is a random function with $dt = 0.2$ on a $2\times 1$ rectangle.  Negative values are black and positive values are white.

<pre class="mcode-input">dt = 0.1;
rng(0), f = randnfun2(dt, [0 2 0 1]);
plot(f), view(0,90), colormap(gray(2))
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])</pre><img src="img/Random2D_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

A contour plot shows more:

<pre class="mcode-input">LW = 'linewidth';
contour(f,LW,2.5)
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])</pre><img src="img/Random2D_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

To isolate the zero contours to high accuracy (though it takes longer), one could use `roots`.

<pre class="mcode-input">c = roots(f);
plot(c,LW,3)
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])</pre><img src="img/Random2D_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here's a 3D plot

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(f)</pre><img src="img/Random2D_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

Here for comparison is a periodic random function:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = randnfun2trig(dt, [0 2 0 1]);
plot(f), view(0,90), colormap(gray(2))
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])</pre><img src="img/Random2D_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

And here is a random function with $dt = 0.05$.

<pre class="mcode-input">dt = 0.05;
f = randnfun2(dt, [0 2 0 1]);
plot(f), view(0,90), colormap(gray(2))
axis equal, axis([0 2 0 1])</pre><img src="img/Random2D_06.png" class="figure" alt="">
