The function $$ f(x) = \int_0^{\infty} {e^{-t} \over 1 + xt} dt $$ is an easy one for Chebfun to evaluate.  For example, the value at $x=1$ is

<pre class="mcode-input">format long
sum(chebfun(@(t) exp(-t)/(1+t),[0 inf]))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.596347362323193
</pre>It's not hard to make a Chebfun of the result, like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(x) sum(chebfun(@(t) exp(-t)/(1+x*t),[0 inf]));
f = chebfun(ff,[0,5]);
hold off, plot(f)

One of the interesting features of $f$ is that its derivatives at $x=0$ are $(0!)^2, -(1!)^2, (2!)^2, -(3!)^2, \dots.$  Chebfun manages to compute a few of these, at any rate, to good accuracy:

<pre class="mcode-input">for j = 0:6
  fj = diff(f,j);
  fprintf('%21.12f  (should be %7.0f)\n',fj(0),(-1)^j*factorial(j)^2)
end</pre><pre class="mcode-output">       1.000000000000  (should be       1)
      -0.999999999998  (should be      -1)
       3.999999996404  (should be       4)
     -35.999996324084  (should be     -36)
     575.997547930357  (should be     576)
  -14398.796599478534  (should be  -14400)
  517929.744379208831  (should be  518400)
</pre>In other words, at $x=0$, $f$ has the asymptotic series $$ f(x) \sim 0! - 1!x + 2!x^2 - 3! x^3 + \cdots . $$ It can't be a Taylor series, because the terms increase too fast: the radius of convergence is zero.

And this brings us to the famous old problem of divergent series, going back to Euler in 1760 and with its own entry in Wikipedia [1].  What is the value of the series $$ 0! - 1! + 2!- 3! + \cdots = ~? $$ Of course the series simply doesn't converge, from one point of view. But this didn't stop Euler and Hardy and many others from discussing what it might mean for such a series to have a limit. And of course we know one pretty good candidate for an answer, namely the value $f(1)$ computed above:

<pre class="mcode-input">f(1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.596347362323191
</pre>Suppose we try to estimate this limit from those not-quite-Taylor coefficients.  We could use the epsilon algorithm, which amounts to constructing a Pade approximation and evaluating it at $z=1$. Here's the result, showing 2 digits of accuracy:

<pre class="mcode-input">r = padeapprox((-1).^(0:10).*factorial(0:10),5,5);
r(1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.597383362132805
</pre>At $z=1/2$ we get 3 or 4 digits:

<pre class="mcode-input">f(0.5)
r(0.5)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.722657233776442
ans =
   0.722739361702127
</pre>
