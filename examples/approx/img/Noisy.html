Suppose a function has some noise.  What's the best way to make a chebfun of it?

For example, consider $$ f(x) = \tanh(8(x-{\textstyle{1\over 2}})) + 10^{-6} \times \hbox{noise}. $$ We can manufacture such a function in a convenient deterministic way like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(x) tanh(8*(x-.5)) + 1e-6*sin((1:length(x))'.^2);</pre>If you try to make a chebfun of `ff`, there is no convergence:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(ff);</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Warning: Function not resolved using 65537 pts. Have you tried 'splitting on'? 
</pre>However, since we know the scale of the noise, it is easy enough to get the right effect by adjusting the Chebfun `eps` parameter:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(ff,'eps',1e-6)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       65        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre>How did we do?  Well, one way to see is to construct a chebfun `f2` of twice this degree.  Here are the Chebyshev coefficients of that function (black dots) superimposed on the those of `f` (blue circles).  The match is very satisfactory.

<pre class="mcode-input">MS = 'markersize';
plotcoeffs(f,'ob',MS,7), ylim([1e-10 10]), hold on
f2 = chebfun(ff,'eps',1e-6,'doublelength');
plotcoeffs(f2,'.k',MS,10), hold off</pre><img src="img/Noisy_01.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

Now, how important was it that we got the amplitude of the noise just right?  Let's repeat the experiment, but with `eps` increased to $10^{-3}$.  As you'd expect, there is a loss of accuracy.

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(ff,'eps',1e-3)
plotcoeffs(f,'ob',MS,7), ylim([1e-10 10]), hold on
plotcoeffs(f2,'.k',MS,10), hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       32        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre><img src="img/Noisy_02.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

And here we are with `eps` tightened to $10^{-9}$:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(ff,'eps',1e-9)
plotcoeffs(f,'ob',MS,7), ylim([1e-10 10]), hold on
plotcoeffs(f2,'.k',MS,10), hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       65        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre><img src="img/Noisy_03.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

This shows that the Chebfun constructor (the code `standardChop`) is pretty flexible about settling for a bit less accuracy than you hoped for.  It's not completely flexible, though, and if we tighten `eps` by a further factor of 1000, there is nonconvergence again:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun(ff,'eps',1e-12);</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Warning: Function not resolved using 65537 pts. Have you tried 'splitting on'? 
</pre>Just for fun let's illustrate what Chebfun achieves by being not completely flexible.  Here is a function that is not random, but again has a plateau in its Chebyshev series down at the level of $10^{-6}$: $$ g(x) =  \tanh(8(x-{\textstyle{1\over 2}})) + 10^{-6} \sin(200\exp(x)). $$

<pre class="mcode-input">gg = @(x) tanh(8*(x-.5)) + 1e-6*sin(200*exp(x));
g = chebfun(gg);
plotcoeffs(g,'ob',MS,4), ylim([1e-18 1e2])</pre><img src="img/Noisy_04.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

If we construct a chebfun with `eps` equal to $10^{-6}$, the plateau is treated as noise and chopped off:

<pre class="mcode-input">g = chebfun(gg,'eps',1e-6); plotcoeffs(g,'ob',MS,4), ylim([1e-18 1e2])</pre><img src="img/Noisy_05.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

With `eps` equal to $10^{-9}$, the plateau is still treated as noise:

<pre class="mcode-input">g = chebfun(gg,'eps',1e-9); plotcoeffs(g,'ob',MS,4), ylim([1e-18 1e2])</pre><img src="img/Noisy_06.png" class="figure" alt=""/>

With `eps` set to $10^{-12}$, however, Chebfun is unsatisfied with the series of length 70, looks further, and correctly captures the low-amplitude component.

<pre class="mcode-input">g = chebfun(gg,'eps',1e-12); plotcoeffs(g,'ob',MS,4), ylim([1e-18 1e2])</pre><img src="img/Noisy_07.png" class="figure" alt=""/>
