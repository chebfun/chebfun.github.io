%% 1. Introduction
% For good reasons of approximation theory, Chebfun relies on
% polynomial interpolation in Chebyshev points, which are
% unequally spaced,
% to represent nonperiodic functions.  However, many people want to
% work with equispaced data, and we are often asked, how can we
% do this in Chebfun?

%%
% Chebfun can do a pretty good job with this
% thanks to the `'equi'` flag introduced by Georges Klein in
% 2011.

%% 2. Example without noise
% Suppose we want to 
% work with the function $e^x\cos(10x)\tanh(4x)$, but all
% we know of it is samples at 40 equispaced points in $[-1,1]$.
% We can construct a Chebfun from this data as follows.  Note
% the `'equi'` flag.
ff = @(x) exp(x).*cos(10*x).*tanh(4*x);
grid = linspace(-1,1,40)';
data = ff(grid);
f = chebfun(data,'equi');

%%
% The plot looks good!
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize'; purple = [.8 0 1];
plot(f,LW,1), hold on, plot(grid,data,'.k',MS,8), hold off
title('chebfun constructed from 40 equispaced data values',FS,10)

%%
% The error is encouragingly small.  It would be bigger with fewer
% data points, smaller with more.
fexact = chebfun(ff);
error = norm(f-fexact,inf)

%%
% For comparison, this is what we get with
% polynomial interpolation of the same data.
% Of course, any Chebfun user knows that polynomial interpolation in
% equispaced points is a bad idea (the Runge phenomenon).
runge = chebfun.interp1(grid,data);
plot(runge,'r',LW,1)
hold on, plot(grid,data,'.k',MS,8), hold off

%%
% So what is this very nice chebfun obtained with the `'equi'` flag,
% and how has Chebfun computed it?

%%
% The answer is that it is a polynomial approximant, but not
% simply the polynomial interpolant.
% In fact it has a higher degree than 40:
f

%%
% To construct this function, Chebfun has first constructed
% a rational function $g$ known as a Floater-Hormann interpolant [1]
% that has good properties with equispaced data, and it has
% picked the order of this approximation in an adaptive fashion.
% Then, since Chebfun works with polynomials rather than rational
% functions, it has approximated $g$ by a chebfun $f$ of the
% usual polynomial kind.

%%
% Here is a plot of the Chebyshev coefficients of $f$:
plotcoeffs(f,'color',purple), axis([0 100 1e-16 10])
title('Chebyshev coefficients',FS,10)

%%
% Note that about half of them are below the level of the accuracy
% of the approximation, so they can't be contributing much.
% We could throw them away like this:
f50 = chebfun(f,51);
error50 = norm(f50-fexact,inf)
plotcoeffs(f50,'color',purple), axis([0 100 1e-16 10])
title('Chebyshev coefficients up to degree 50',FS,10)

%%
% Another approach would be construct the original chebfun
% with a loosened value of |eps|:
floose = chebfun(data,'equi','eps',1e-6);
errorloose = norm(floose-fexact,inf)
plotcoeffs(floose,'color',purple), axis([0 100 1e-16 10])
title('Chebyshev coefficients with loosened tolerance',FS,10)

%% 3. Example with noise
% What about a function with noise?  Let's add random perturbations
% of size $10^{-1}$ to the data:
rng('default'); rng(0)
data = data + 1e-1*randn(size(data));

%%
% Here is what we get if we construct a equispaced chebfun
% with `eps = 1e-2`:
ep = 1e-2;
f = chebfun(data,'equi','eps',ep);
plot(f,LW,1), hold on, plot(grid,data,'.k',MS,8), hold off
s = sprintf('noisy data with ''equi'', eps = 1e-2: length(f) = %d',length(f));
title(s,FS,12)

%%
% And here is the same experiment but with `eps` three times
% as large.:
ep = 3e-2;
f = chebfun(data,'equi','eps',ep);
plot(f,LW,1), hold on, plot(grid,data,'.k',MS,8), hold off
s = sprintf('noisy data with ''equi'', eps = 3e-2: length(f) = %d',length(f));
title(s,FS,12)

%% 4. Discussion
% What's nice about these `'equi'` approximations is that, as
% usual with chebfuns, they are globally smooth functions, and
% can be differentiated, for example, without any anomalies
% arising.  In some
% applications this is very appealing.

%%
% Another globally smooth way to deal with equispaced data,
% besides the Floater-Hormann approach, is to use
% so-called _Gregory interpolants_ [2].  This idea, however,
% has not been implemented in Chebfun.
