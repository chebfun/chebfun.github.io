My essay "Six myths of polynomial interpolation and quadrature", reproduced as an appendix in [1], closes with an example that reminds one of a tiger's tail. Here with a few modifications is that example:

<pre class="mcode-input">x = chebfun('x',[-2 1]);
LW = 'linewidth'; MS = 'markersize';
CO = 'color'; orange = [1 .5 .25];
f = 2*exp(.5*x).*(sin(5*x) + sin(101*x));
roundf = round(f);
r = roots(f-roundf,'nojump');
hold off, plot(f,LW,2,CO,orange), hold on
ylim([-8 6])
plot(r,f(r),'.k',MS,12), hold off</pre><img src="img/Tiger_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

Let's look at what's going on here.  First of all a chebfun $f$ is constructed:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(f,LW,1.6,CO,orange)
ylim([-8 6])</pre><img src="img/Tiger_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

Then another chebfun is constructed consisting of $f$ rounded to integers:

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(roundf,LW,0.8,'-k','jumpline','k')
ylim([-8 6])</pre><img src="img/Tiger_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

Superimposing the two curves yields a lot of intersections, which are computed by `roots`:

<pre class="mcode-input">number_of_roots = length(r)
plot(f,LW,1.6,CO,orange), hold on
plot(roundf,LW,0.8,'-k','jumpline','k')
plot(r,f(r),'.k',MS,8), hold off</pre><pre class="mcode-output">number_of_roots =
   345
</pre><img src="img/Tiger_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

In [1], dots appear not only where $f$ is equal to an integer, but also where it is equal to a half-integer. In the present version of the tiger's tail, this effect has been eliminated by use of the `'nojump'` flag in `roots`.
