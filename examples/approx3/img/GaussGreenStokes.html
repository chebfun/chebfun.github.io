In this example we illustrate Gauss's theorem, Green's identities, and Stokes' theorem in Chebfun3.



## 1. Gauss's theorem

Gauss's theorem, also known as the divergence theorem, asserts that the integral of the sources of a vector field in a domain $K$ is equal to the flux of the vector field through the boundary: $$ \int_K \mbox{div}(\vec{v}) \, dV = \int_{\partial K} \vec{v} \cdot \vec{dS}. $$ Here $\vec{dS}$ is the vectorial surface element given by $\vec{dS} = \vec{n} dS$, where $\vec{n}$ is the outward normal vector to the surface $\partial K$ and $dS$ is the surface element.

Let us consider a simple 3D vector field $\vec{v}$ on the cube $K = [-1, 1]^3$:

<pre class="mcode-input">cheb.xyz;
v1 = x.^2-y; v2 = y.^2; v3 = z;
v = [ v1 ; v2 ; v3 ];</pre>Here we have built $\vec{v}$ by stacking three Chebfun3 objects one over another, beginning with the command `cheb.xyz` to generate chebfun3 objects `x`, `y`, and `z` corresponding to the functions $x$, $y$, and $z$. Alternatively we could pass three function handles directly to the Chebfun3v constructor; see the example for Stokes' Theorem below.

The left-hand side of the identity of Gauss's theorem, the integral of the divergence, can be computed in Chebfun3 like this, nicely matching the exact value 8:

<pre class="mcode-input">format long
I1 = sum3(div(v))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I1 =
   7.999999999999998
</pre>For the right-hand side we need the flux integral over the boundary of the cube, which consists of six surfaces.  The outward normal vectors on the sides $\{ \pm 1 \} \times [-1, 1]^2$ are $\pm [1; 0; 0]$.  Thus we have to integrate $\vec{v}(\pm 1, y, z) \cdot [\pm 1; 0; 0] = \pm v_1(\pm 1, y, z)$ over these sides of the cube.  The restrictions $v_1(\pm 1,:,:)$ are represented as chebfun2 objects.  Treating the other two pairs of sides similarly, we compute a result again with excellent accuracy:

<pre class="mcode-input">I2 = sum2(v1(1,:,:)) - sum2(v1(-1,:,:)) + ...
     sum2(v2(:,1,:)) - sum2(v2(:,-1,:)) + ...
     sum2(v3(:,:,1)) - sum2(v3(:,:,-1))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I2 =
     8
</pre>

## 2. Green's identities

The first Green identity is an analogue of integration by parts in higher dimensions: $$ \int_K ( f \Delta g + \nabla f \cdot \nabla g ) \, dV = \int_{\partial K} f \nabla g \cdot \vec{dS}. $$ This is a corollary of the Gauss's theorem (set $\vec{v} = f \nabla g$). The second Green identity is $$ \int_K (f \Delta g - (\Delta f) g ) \, dV = \int_{\partial K} ( f \nabla g - g \nabla f ) \cdot \vec{dS}. $$ In both formulas $f$ and $g$ are scalar functions on $K$.  To illustrate both formulas in Chebfun3, let us consider the functions

<pre class="mcode-input">f = 1 + x.*exp(y+z);
g = x.^2 + y.^2 + z.^2;
isosurface(g,1.3,'r'), axis equal, grid on</pre><img src="img/GaussGreenStokes_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

The Laplacian and gradient of $f$ can be computed with `lap(f)` and `grad(f)`. We evaluate the two sides of the first Green identity in the same way as for the Gauss's theorem above.  The exact value $48$ is matched closely by the integral over the cube,

<pre class="mcode-input">I3 = sum3(f .* lap(g) + dot(grad(f), grad(g)))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I3 =
  47.999999999999986
</pre>The flux integral also agrees:

<pre class="mcode-input">v = f * grad(g);
v1 = v(1); v2 = v(2); v3 = v(3);
I4 = sum2(v1(1,:,:)) - sum2(v1(-1,:,:)) + ...
     sum2(v2(:,1,:)) - sum2(v2(:,-1,:)) + ...
     sum2(v3(:,:,1)) - sum2(v3(:,:,-1))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I4 =
    48
</pre>For the second Green formula the exact value of the integrals is again $48$. We compute

<pre class="mcode-input">I5 = sum3(f .* lap(g) - lap(f) .* g)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I5 =
  48.000000000000526
</pre>and

<pre class="mcode-input">v = f * grad(g) - g * grad(f);
v1 = v(1); v2 = v(2); v3 = v(3);
I6 = sum2(v1(1,:,:)) - sum2(v1(-1,:,:)) + ...
     sum2(v2(:,1,:)) - sum2(v2(:,-1,:)) + ...
     sum2(v3(:,:,1)) - sum2(v3(:,:,-1))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I6 =
  47.999999999999950
</pre>

## 3.  Stokes' Theorem

Stokes' Theorem in its classical formulation takes the form $$ \int_S \mbox{curl}(\vec{v}) \cdot \vec{dS} = \int_{\partial S} \vec{v} \cdot \vec{ds}. $$ Here, the vectorial line element $\vec{ds}$ is $\vec{ds} = \vec{t} ds$, where $\vec{t}$ is the tangential vector and $ds$ is the scalar line element. As an easy example we consider the surface given by the unit disk in the $x$ - $y$ plane, which can be parametrised by

<pre class="mcode-input">Phi = chebfun2v(@(rho,phi) rho.*cos(phi), @(rho,phi) rho.*sin(phi), ...
    @(rho,phi) 0, [0, 1, 0, 2*pi]);
surf(Phi)</pre><img src="img/GaussGreenStokes_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

We consider again the vector field $\vec{v}$ from the beginning, which we now construct by passing three function handles to the Chebfun3v constructor:

<pre class="mcode-input">v = chebfun3v(@(x,y,z) x.^2 - y, @(x,y,z) y.^2, @(x,y,z) z);
quiver3(v)</pre><img src="img/GaussGreenStokes_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The curl of $\vec{v}$ is computed by

<pre class="mcode-input">curlv = curl(v);
quiver3(curlv)</pre><img src="img/GaussGreenStokes_04.png" class="figure" alt="">

Note how the curl of $\vec{v}$ points up, just through the surface we are considering.

The composition $\mbox{curl}(\vec{v})(\Phi)$ can be obtained as

<pre class="mcode-input">curlv1 = curlv(1); curlv2 = curlv(2); curlv3 = curlv(3);
curlvPhi = chebfun2v(@(rho,phi) curlv1(rho.*cos(phi), rho.*sin(phi), 0*rho), ...
    @(rho,phi) curlv2(rho.*cos(phi), rho.*sin(phi), 0*rho), ...
    @(rho,phi) curlv3(rho.*cos(phi), rho.*sin(phi), 0*rho), ...
    [0, 1, 0, 2*pi]);</pre>The flux integral is then simply

<pre class="mcode-input">I7 = sum2(dot(curlvPhi, normal(Phi)))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I7 =
   3.141592653589794
</pre>The exact value is $\pi$,

<pre class="mcode-input">pi</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   3.141592653589793
</pre>To compute the line integral over the boundary of the surface, we first parametrize the circle by

<pre class="mcode-input">gamma = chebfun(@(t) [cos(t), sin(t), 0*t], [0, 2*pi]);</pre>Then the line integral is

<pre class="mcode-input">I8 = integral(v, gamma)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I8 =
   3.141592653589794
</pre>
