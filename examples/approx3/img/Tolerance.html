## 1. Tolerances in Chebfun

Chebfun's default tolerance is machine precision in 1D, 2D, and 3D:

<pre class="mcode-input">chebfuneps
chebfun2eps
chebfun3eps</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     2.220446049250313e-16
ans =
     2.220446049250313e-16
ans =
     2.220446049250313e-16
</pre>In 1D, there is usually not much to be gained by loosening the tolerance (unless you are working with noisy functions), and we have long recommended that users leave `chebfuneps` at its factory value.  (There is an FAQ question at `www.chebfun.org` on this topic.)  In 2D and especially 3D, however, loosening the tolerance is often worthwhile. This is discussed in Section 18.10 of the _Chebfun Guide_.

The reason the default tolerance is machine precision is that accurate results are often easily achievable.  For example, suppose we want to compute the triple integral $$ I = \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1 \int_{-1}^1 \exp(\sin(xyz + \exp(xyz))) dz dy dx . $$ We could do it like this,

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
f = chebfun3(@(x,y,z) exp(sin(x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z))));
format long
I = sum3(f)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  17.885693411606855
Elapsed time is 1.971261 seconds.
</pre>We could also do it like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
cheb.xyz
f = exp(sin(x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z)));
I = sum3(f)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  17.885693411606852
Elapsed time is 2.406762 seconds.
</pre>These results are quite satisfactory, because this chebfun3 is of only medium complexity:

<pre class="mcode-input">f
[m,n,p] = length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun3 object 
   cols: [Inf x 25 chebfun]
   rows: [Inf x 26 chebfun]
  tubes: [Inf x 26 chebfun]
   core: [25 x 26 x 26 double]
 domain: [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
 vertical scale = 2.7 
m =
    42
n =
    41
p =
    42
</pre>

## 2. Slowdown for complicated functions

On the other hand, if we make the function more complicated, things slow down:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
g = chebfun3(@(x,y,z) exp(sin(10*x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z))));
I = sum3(g)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  13.580020953068932
Elapsed time is 45.432293 seconds.
</pre>Here are the parameters of the more complicated function:

<pre class="mcode-input">g
[m,n,p] = length(g)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">g =
   chebfun3 object 
   cols: [Inf x 67 chebfun]
   rows: [Inf x 69 chebfun]
  tubes: [Inf x 69 chebfun]
   core: [67 x 69 x 69 double]
 domain: [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
 vertical scale = 2.7 
m =
   156
n =
   156
p =
   156
</pre>

## 3. Speedup if the tolerance is loosened

A considerable speedup can often be achieved by working with a looser tolerance.  One way to construct the chebfun3 with tolerance $10^{-8}$ is like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
g = chebfun3(@(x,y,z) exp(sin(10*x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z))),'eps',1e-8);
I = sum3(g)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  13.580020719458481
Elapsed time is 3.393932 seconds.
</pre>Note that the value of $I$ agrees with the previous result to quite a few digits.  Here is the newly constructed chebfun3:

<pre class="mcode-input">g
[m,n,p] = length(g)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">g =
   chebfun3 object 
   cols: [Inf x 40 chebfun]
   rows: [Inf x 38 chebfun]
  tubes: [Inf x 37 chebfun]
   core: [40 x 38 x 37 double]
 domain: [-1, 1] x [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]
 vertical scale = 2.7 
m =
    86
n =
    86
p =
    86
</pre>Sometimes one wants to loosen the tolerance globally, e.g. if there will be further computations, like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">chebfun3eps 1e-8
tic
cheb.xyz
g = exp(sin(10*x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z)));
I = sum3(g)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  13.580023462274925
Elapsed time is 4.338277 seconds.
</pre>Let's try just four digits:

<pre class="mcode-input">chebfun3eps 1e-4
tic
g = exp(sin(10*x.*y.*z + exp(x.*y.*z)));
I = sum3(g)
toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">I =
  13.606974798906183
Elapsed time is 1.165816 seconds.
</pre>The computed integral still has several correct digits.

As good citizens, we now return the tolerance to its factory value:

<pre class="mcode-input">chebfun3eps factory</pre>
