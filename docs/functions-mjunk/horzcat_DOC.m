%% HORZCAT :: Horizontal concatenation of CHEBFUN objects.
%    [A B] horizontally concatenates the CHEBFUN objects A and B to form an
%    array-valued CHEBFUN or an array of CHEBFUN objects (depending on whether
%    the interior breakpoints of A and B match or not). [A,B] does the same. Any
%    number of CHEBFUN objects can be concatenated within one pair of brackets.
