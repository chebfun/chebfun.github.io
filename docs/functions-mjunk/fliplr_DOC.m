%% FLIPLR :: Flip/reverse a CHEBFUN.
%    G = FLIPLR(F), where F is a row CHEBFUN, returns a CHEBFUN G with the same
%    domain as F but reversed; that is, G(x) = F(a+b-x), where the domain is
%    [a,b].
% 
%    FLIPLR(F), where F is an array-valued column CHEBFUN or a quasimatrix,
%    reverses the order of the columns of F.
