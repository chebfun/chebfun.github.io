## 1.1  What is a chebfun?

A chebfun is a function of one variable defined on an interval $[a,b]$. The syntax for chebfuns is almost exactly the same as the usual MATLAB syntax for vectors, with the familiar MATLAB commands for vectors overloaded in natural ways. Thus, for example, whereas `sum(f)` returns the sum of the entries when `f` is a vector, it returns a definite integral when `f` is a chebfun.

Chebfun with a capital C is the name of the software system.

The aim of Chebfun is to "feel symbolic but run at the speed of numerics". More precisely, our vision is to achieve for functions what floating-point arithmetic achieves for numbers: rapid computation in which each successive operation is carried out exactly apart from a rounding error that is very small in relative terms [Trefethen 2007].

The implementation of Chebfun is based on the mathematical fact that smooth functions can be represented very efficiently by polynomial interpolation in Chebyshev points, or equivalently, thanks to the Fast Fourier Transform, by expansions in Chebyshev polynomials.  For a simple function, 20 or 30 points often suffice, but the process is stable and effective even for functions complicated enough to require 1000 or 1,000,000 points. Chebfun makes use of adaptive procedures that aim to find the right number of points automatically so as to represent each function to roughly machine precision, that is, about 15 or 16 digits of relative accuracy.  (Originally Chebfun stored function values at Chebyshev points; in Version 5 it switched to storing Chebyshev expansion coefficients.)

The mathematical foundations of Chebfun are for the most part well established by results scattered throughout the 20th century.  A key early figure, for example, was Bernstein in the 1910s. Much of the relevant material can be found collected in the Chebfun-based book _Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice_ [Trefethen 2013].

Chebfun was originally created by Zachary Battles and Nick Trefethen at Oxford during 2002-2005 [Battles &amp; Trefethen 2004].  Battles left the project in 2005, and soon four new members were added to the team: Ricardo Pachon (from 2006), Rodrigo Platte (from 2007), and Toby Driscoll and Nick Hale (from 2008). In 2009, Asgeir Birkisson and Mark Richardson also became involved, and other contributors included Pedro Gonnet, Joris Van Deun, and Georges Klein.  Nick Hale served as Director of the project during 2010-2014.  The Chebfun Version 5 rewrite was directed by Nick Hale during 2013-2014, and the team included Anthony Austin, Asgeir Birkisson, Toby Driscoll, Hrothgar, Mohsin Javed, Hadrien Montanelli, Alex Townsend, Nick Trefethen, Grady Wright, and Kuan Xu. October 2014 brough new arrivals Jared Aurentz,  and Behnam Hashemi.  In 2019 the team includes also Nicolas Boulle, Abi Gopal, Yuji Nakatsukasa, and Ryan Sherbo. Further information about Chebfun history is available at the Chebfun web site, [http://www.chebfun.org](<http://www.chebfun.org>), where one can also find a discussion of other software projects related to Chebfun. This Guide is based on Chebfun Version 5.7.0, released in June 2017.



## 1.2  Constructing simple chebfuns

The `chebfun` command constructs a chebfun from a specification such as a string or an anonymous function.  If you don't specify an interval, then the default interval $[-1,1]$ is used. For example, the following command makes a chebfun corresponding to $\cos(20x)$ on $[-1,1]$ and plots it.

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = chebfun('cos(20*x)');
  plot(f), ylim([-1.2,1.2])</pre><img src="img/guide01_01.png" class="figure" alt="">

From this little experiment, you cannot see that `f` is represented by a polynomial.  One way to see this is to find the length of `f`:

<pre class="mcode-input">  length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
    51
</pre>Another is to remove the semicolon that suppresses output:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]       51      0.41     0.41 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre>These results tell us that `f` is represented by a polynomial interpolant through 51 Chebyshev points, i.e., a polynomial of degree 50.  These numbers have been determined by an adaptive process.  We can see the data points by plotting `f` with the `'.-'` option:

<pre class="mcode-input">  plot(f,'.-'), ylim([-1.2 1.2])</pre><img src="img/guide01_02.png" class="figure" alt="">

The formula for $N+1$ Chebyshev points in $[-1,1]$ is $$ x(j) = -\cos(j \pi/N), \quad  j = 0:N, $$ and in the figure we can see that the points are clustered accordingly near $1$ and $-1$. Note that in the middle of the grid, there are about 5 points per wavelength, which is evidently what it takes to represent this cosine to 15 digits of accuracy.  For intervals other than $[-1,1]$, appropriate Chebyshev points are obtained by a linear scaling.

The curve between the data points is the polynomial interpolant, which can be evaluated by the barycentric formula introduced by Salzer [Berrut &amp; Trefethen 2004, Salzer 1972].  This method of evaluating polynomial interpolants is stable and efficient even if the degree is in the millions [Higham 2004].  Chebfun actually evaluates polynomials from their Chebyshev series rather than by barycentric interpolation; the difference in the two methods is little.

What is the integral of $f$ from $-1$ to $1$?  Here it is:

<pre class="mcode-input">  sum(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.091294525072763
</pre>This number was computed by integrating the polynomial (Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature -- see Section 2.1), and it is interesting to compare it to the exact answer from calculus:

<pre class="mcode-input">  exact = sin(20)/10</pre><pre class="mcode-output">exact =
   0.091294525072763
</pre>Here is another example, now with the chebfun defined by an anonymous function instead of a string. In this case the interval is specified as $[0,100]$.

<pre class="mcode-input">  g = chebfun(@(t) besselj(0,t),[0,100]);
  plot(g), ylim([-.5 1])</pre><img src="img/guide01_03.png" class="figure" alt="">

The function looks complicated, but it is actually a polynomial of surprisingly small degree:

<pre class="mcode-input">  length(g)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
    89
</pre>Is it accurate?  Well, here are three random points in $[0,100]$:

<pre class="mcode-input">  format long
  x = 100*rand(3,1)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">x =
  81.472368639317892
  90.579193707561927
  12.698681629350606
</pre>Let's compare the chebfun to the true Bessel function at these points:

<pre class="mcode-input">  exact = besselj(0,x);
  error = g(x) - exact;
  [g(x) exact error]</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.048059538377880   0.048059538377880   0.000000000000000
  -0.021311086924089  -0.021311086924090   0.000000000000000
   0.176415464952875   0.176415464952875  -0.000000000000000
</pre>If you want to know the first 5 zeros of the Bessel function, here they are:

<pre class="mcode-input">  r = roots(g); r = r(1:5)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">r =
   2.404825557695756
   5.520078110286287
   8.653727912911013
  11.791534439014278
  14.930917708487790
</pre>Notice that we have just done something nontrivial and potentially useful.  How else would you find zeros of the Bessel function so readily? As always with numerical computation, we cannot expect the answers to be exactly correct, but they will usually be very close. In fact, these computed zeros are accurate to close to machine precision:

<pre class="mcode-input">  besselj(0,r)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.0e-14 *
   0.891222737425086
  -0.809539285445395
   0.010653221425832
  -0.058908346770306
  -0.092296985262750
</pre>Most often we get a chebfun by operating on other chebfuns. For example, here is a sequence that uses plus, times, divide, and power operations on an initial chebfun `x` to produce a famous function of Runge:

<pre class="mcode-input">  x = chebfun('x');
  f = 1/(1+25*x^2);
  length(f)
  clf, plot(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   187
</pre><img src="img/guide01_04.png" class="figure" alt="">



## 1.3  Operations on chebfuns

There are more than 300 commands that can be applied to a chebfun.  For a list of many of them you can type `methods`:

</pre>Most of the commands in the list above exist in ordinary MATLAB; some exceptions are `domain`, `restrict`, and `chebcoeffs`. We have already seen `length` and `sum` in action.  In fact we have already seen `subsref` too, since that is the MATLAB command for (among other things) evaluating arguments in parentheses.  Here is another example of its use:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f(0.5)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.137931034482759
</pre>Here for comparison is the true result:

<pre class="mcode-input">  1/(1+25/4)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.137931034482759
</pre>In this Runge function example, we have also implicitly seen `times`, `plus`, `power`, and `rdivide`, all of which have been overloaded from their usual MATLAB uses to apply to chebfuns.

In the next part of this tour we shall explore many of these commands systematically.  First, however, we should see that chebfuns are not restricted to smooth functions.



## 1.4  Piecewise smooth chebfuns

Many functions of interest are not smooth but piecewise smooth.  In this case a chebfun may consist of a concatenation of smooth pieces, each with its own polynomial representation.  Each of the smooth pieces is called a "fun".  This enhancement of Chebfun was developed initially by Ricardo Pachon during 2006-2007, then also by Rodrigo Platte starting in 2007 [Pachon, Platte and Trefethen 2010]. Essentially funs are the "classic chebfuns" for smooth functions on $[-1,1]$ originally implemented by Zachary Battles in Chebfun Version 1.

Later we shall describe the options in greater detail, but for the moment let us see some examples.  One way to get a piecewise smooth function is directly from the Chebfun constructor, taking advantage of its capability of automatic edge detection.  For example, in the default "splitting off" mode a function with a jump in its derivative produces a warning message,

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = chebfun('abs(x-.3)');</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Warning: Function not resolved using 65537 pts. Have you tried 'splitting on'? 
</pre>The same function can be successfully captured with splitting on:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = chebfun('abs(x-.3)','splitting','on');</pre>The `length` command reveals that `f` is defined by four data points, two for each linear interval:

<pre class="mcode-input">  length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
     4
</pre>We can see the structure of `f` in more detail by typing `f` without a semicolon:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (2 smooth pieces)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,     0.3]        2       1.3        0 
[     0.3,       1]        2   5.6e-17      0.7 
vertical scale = 1.3    Total length = 4
</pre>This output confirms that f consists of two funs, each defined by two points and two corresponding function values. The functions live on intervals defined by breakpoints at $-1$, $1$, and a number very close to $0.3$.

Another way to make a piecewise smooth chebfun is to construct it explicitly from various pieces.  For example, the following command specifies three functions $x^2$, $1$, and $4-x$, together with a vector of endpoints indicating that the first function applies on $[-1,1]$, the second on $[1,2]$, and the third on $[2,4]$:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = chebfun({@(x) x^2, 1, @(x) 4-x},[-1 1 2 4]);
  plot(f)</pre><img src="img/guide01_05.png" class="figure" alt="">

We expect `f` to consist of three pieces of lengths 3, 1, and 2, and this is indeed the case:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (3 smooth pieces)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        3         1        1 
[       1,       2]        1         1        1 
[       2,       4]        2         2        0 
vertical scale =   2    Total length = 6
</pre>Our eyes see pieces, but to Chebfun, `f` is just another function.  For example, here is its integral.

<pre class="mcode-input">  sum(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   3.666666666666667
</pre>Here is an algebraic transformation of `f`, which we plot in another color for variety.

<pre class="mcode-input">  plot(1/(1+f),'r')</pre><img src="img/guide01_06.png" class="figure" alt="">

Some Chebfun commands naturally introduce breakpoints in a chebfun. For example, the `abs` command first finds zeros of a function and introduces breakpoints there.  Here is a chebfun consisting of 6 funs:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = abs(exp(x).*sin(8*x));
  plot(f)</pre><img src="img/guide01_07.png" class="figure" alt="">

And here is an example where breakpoints are introduced by the `max` command, leading to a chebfun with 13 pieces:

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = sin(20*x);
  g = exp(x-1);
  h = max(f,g);
  plot(h), ylim([0 1.2])</pre><img src="img/guide01_08.png" class="figure" alt="">

As always, `h` may look complicated to a human, but to Chebfun it is just a function.  Here are its mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum:

<pre class="mcode-input">  mean(h)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.578242020778010
</pre><pre class="mcode-input">  std(h)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =

</pre><pre class="mcode-input">  max(h)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.000000000000000
</pre>A final note about piecewise smooth chebfuns is that the automatic edge detection or "splitting" feature, when it is turned on, may subdivide functions even though they do not have clean point singularities, and this may be desirable or undesirable depending on the application.  For example, considering $\sin(x)$ over $[0,1000\pi]$ with splitting on, we end up with a chebfun with many pieces:

<pre class="mcode-input">  tic, f = chebfun('sin(x)',[0 1000*pi],'splitting','on'), toc</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =

Elapsed time is 0.265972 seconds.
</pre>In this case it is more efficient -- and more interesting mathematically -- to omit the splitting and construct one global chebfun:

Elapsed time is 0.035212 seconds.
</pre>Splitting on and off are discussed further in Section 8.3.



## 1.5  Infinite intervals and infinite function values

A major change from Chebfun Version 2 to Version 3 was the generalization of chebfuns to allow certain functions on infinite intervals or which diverge to infinity; the initial credit for these innovations belongs to Nick Hale, Rodrigo Platte, and Mark Richardson, and many later developments are due to Kuan Xu. For example, here is a function on the whole real axis,

<pre class="mcode-input">  f = chebfun('exp(-x^2/16).*(1+.2*cos(10*x))',[-inf,inf]);
  plot(f)</pre><img src="img/guide01_09.png" class="figure" alt="">

and here is its integral:

<pre class="mcode-input">  sum(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">Warning: Result may not be accurate as the function decays slowly at infinity. 
ans =
   7.089815403622063
</pre>Here's the integral of a function on $[1,\infty)$:

<pre class="mcode-input">  sum(chebfun('1/x^4',[1 inf]))</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.333333333328451
</pre>Notice that several digits of accuracy have been lost here.  Be careful! -- operations involving infinities in Chebfun are not always as accurate and robust as their finite counterparts.

Here is an example of a function that diverges to infinity, which we can capture with the `'exps'` flag; see Chapter 7 for details:

<pre class="mcode-input">  h = chebfun('(1/pi)/sqrt(1-x^2)','exps',[-.5 -.5]);
  plot(h)</pre><img src="img/guide01_10.png" class="figure" alt="">

In this case the integral comes out just right:

<pre class="mcode-input">  sum(h)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.000000000000000
</pre>For more on the treatment of infinities in Chebfun, see Chapter 9.



## 1.6  Periodic functions

Until 2014, Chebfun used only nonperiodic representations, based on Chebyshev polynomials.  Beginning with Version 5, a new capability was introduced for representing sufficiently smooth periodic functions by trigonometric polynomials instead, that is, Fourier series.  Such an object is still called a chebfun, but it is a periodic one, and the signal to invoke such capabilities is the string ``trig``. For abbreviation, we call a periodic chebfun a "trigfun". This section gives a quick introduction, and more details can be found in Chapter 11.

Trigfuns were initiated by Grady Wright in the first half of 2014 [Wright et al. 2015]. Another project along the same lines was carried out independently by Kristyn McLeod and Rodrigo Platte at Arizona State University [McLeod 2014].

For example, here is a periodic function on $[-\pi,\pi]$ represented in the usual way by a Chebyshev series.

<pre class="mcode-input">ff = @(t) sin(t) + cos(2*t) - cos(t)/3 + cos(100*t)/6;
f = chebfun(ff,[-pi,pi]);
max(f)
plot(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.614526099978750
</pre><img src="img/guide01_11.png" class="figure" alt="">

Its length, very roughly, is $100 \pi$,

<pre class="mcode-input">length(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   383
</pre>Here is the same function represented by a Fourier series:

<pre class="mcode-input">f2 = chebfun(ff,[-pi,pi],'trig');
max(f2)
plot(f2,'m')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.614526099978745
</pre><img src="img/guide01_12.png" class="figure" alt="">

Its length is now only about $200$ (exactly 201). This improvement by a factor of about $\pi/2$ is typical.

<pre class="mcode-input">length(f2)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   201
</pre>Sampling at a few arbitrary points confirms that the two functions agree closely:

<pre class="mcode-input">xx = [1/3 sqrt(2) exp(1)];
f(xx) - f2(xx)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   1.0e-14 *
   0.355271367880050   0.222044604925031   0.111022302462516
</pre>Readers may be interested to compare `plotcoeffs` applied to the first and second versions of $f$.  Rather than display that here we shall turn to a simpler example involving a shorter Fourier series.  Consider the function

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun('7 + sin(t) + exp(1)*cos(2*t)',[-pi,pi],'trig')</pre><pre class="mcode-output">f =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values trig
[    -3.1,     3.1]        5       9.7      9.7 
vertical scale = 9.7 
</pre>Here are the coefficients of $f$ as an expansion in sines and cosines:

<pre class="mcode-input">[a,b] = trigcoeffs(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">a =
   7.000000000000000
   0.000000000000001
   2.718281828459045
b =
   1.000000000000000
                   0
</pre>Here they are as an expansion in complex exponentials:

<pre class="mcode-input">c = trigcoeffs(f)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">c =
  1.359140914229522 + 0.000000000000000i
  0.000000000000000 + 0.500000000000000i
  7.000000000000000 + 0.000000000000000i
  0.000000000000000 - 0.500000000000000i
  1.359140914229522 + 0.000000000000000i
</pre>Bookkeeping of Fourier coefficients can often be a headache. If these examples don't make the patterns clear, details can be found with `help trigcoeffs`.

For a mathematically less trivial example, here is the cosine expansion of a function whose Fourier series coefficients are known to be values of a Bessel function:

<pre class="mcode-input">f = chebfun('exp(cos(t))',[-pi pi],'trig');
[a,b] = trigcoeffs(f);
n = floor(length(f)/2);
exact = 2*besseli(0:n,1); exact(1) = exact(1)/2;
disp('        computed             exact')
disp([a exact'])</pre><pre class="mcode-output">        computed             exact

## 1.7  Rows, columns, and quasimatrices

MATLAB doesn't only deal with column vectors: there are also row vectors and matrices.  The same is true of Chebfun. The chebfuns shown so far have all been in column orientation, which is the default, but one can also take the transpose, compute inner products, and so on:

<pre class="mcode-input">  x = chebfun(@(x) x)</pre><pre class="mcode-output">x =
   chebfun column (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        2        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre><pre class="mcode-input">  x'</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   chebfun row (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        2        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre><pre class="mcode-input">  x'*x</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   0.666666666666667
</pre>One can also make matrices whose columns are chebfuns or whose rows are chebfuns, like this:

<pre class="mcode-input">  A = [1 x x.^2]</pre><pre class="mcode-output">A =
   chebfun column1 (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        3         1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
   chebfun column2 (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        3        -1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
   chebfun column3 (1 smooth piece)
       interval       length     endpoint values  
[      -1,       1]        3         1        1 
vertical scale =   1 
</pre><pre class="mcode-input">  A'*A</pre><pre class="mcode-output">ans =
   2.000000000000000  -0.000000000000000   0.666666666666667
                   0   0.666666666666667   0.000000000000000
   0.666666666666667                   0   0.400000000000000
</pre>These are called _quasimatrices_, and they are discussed in Chapter 6.



## 1.8  Chebfun features not in this Guide

Some of Chebfun's most remarkable features haven't made it into this edition of the Guide.  Here are some of our favorites:

o `leg2cheb` and `cheb2leg` for fast Legendre-Chebyshev conversions (also `legvals2chebcoeffs`, `chebcoeffs2legpts`, and ten more)

o `conv` for convolution,

o The `'equi'` flag to the Chebfun constructor for equispaced data,

o `polyfit` for least-squares fitting in the continuous context,

o `inv` for computing the inverse of a chebfun,

o `pde15s` for PDEs in one space and one time variable.

To learn about any of these options, try the appropriate `help` command.  Just as a taster, here's a hint of how fast Chebfun can convert a ten-thousand coefficient Chebyshev expansion to Legendre coefficients and back again using an algorithm from [Hale &amp; Townsend 2013]:

<pre class="mcode-input">tic
ccheb = randn(10000,1);
cleg = cheb2leg(ccheb);
ccheb2 = leg2cheb(cleg);

Elapsed time is 0.131316 seconds.

## 1.9  Chebfun example galleries

MATLAB has long had a `gallery` command to generate interesting matrices, and Chebfun has an analogous `gallery` command to generate interesting functions.

Here is what is currently available:

<pre class="mcode-input">help cheb.gallery</pre><pre class="mcode-output"> CHEB.GALLERY   Chebfun example functions.
    F = CHEB.GALLERY(NAME) returns a chebfun or a quasimatrix corresponding to
    NAME.  See the listing below for available names.
 
    For example,  plot(cheb.gallery('zigzag'))  plots a degree 10000 polynomial
    that doesn't look like a polynomial, and  plot(cheb.gallery('gamma'))  shows
    a chebfun with poles. For details of how each function is constructed, try
    type +cheb/gallery  or  edit cheb.gallery.
 
    [F,FA] = CHEB.GALLERY(NAME) also returns the anonymous function FA used to
    define the function. Some gallery functions are generated by operations
    beyond the usual Chebfun constructor (e.g. by solving ODEs), so FA in those
    cases simply evaluates the chebfun.
 
    CHEB.GALLERY with no input argument returns a random function from the
    gallery.
 
    CHEB.GALLERY with no output argument creates a plot of the selected
    function.

In this instance the underlying code fits in a line,

<pre class="mcode-input">fa = @airy; p = chebfun(fa, [-40,40]);</pre>Some examples make use of more complicated code, like this approximation to a Daubechies wavelet scaling function (accurate to about 3 digits of accuracy; the underlying function is a fractal):

<pre class="mcode-input">plot(cheb.gallery('daubechies')), ylim([-0.5 1.5])
title('Daubechies scaling function')</pre><img src="img/guide01_14.png" class="figure" alt="">

To find out how a gallery example was generated, take a look at the code with `type +cheb/gallery` or `edit +cheb/gallery`.

Like the MATLAB `gallery` command, `cheb.gallery` produces a plot if you call it without specifying output variables. To illustrate, let us finish with an example the Chebfun team enjoys from the appendix to [Trefethen 2013], "Six myths of polynomial interpolation and quadrature":

<pre class="mcode-input">cheb.gallery('zigzag')</pre><img src="img/guide01_15.png" class="figure" alt="">

This function looks piecewise linear, but in fact, it is a polynomial of degree 10000.  This serves no purpose from an approximation point of view -- one would never represent this function in this manner -- but it illustrates the robustness of high-degree polynomial approximation.

If you call `cheb.gallery` without any input arguments, it selects a gallery function at random.

Other collections worth exploring include `cheb.gallerytrig` for periodic functions and `cheb.gallery2` for 2D functions.



## 1.10  How this Guide is produced

This guide is produced in MATLAB using the `publish` command with a style sheet somewhat different from the usual; the output of `publish` is then processed by Markdown. To publish a chapter for yourself, make sure the chebfun guide directory is in your path and then type, for example, `open(publish('guide1'))`.  The formatting may not be exactly right but it should certainly be intelligible.
