%% 16.1 Introduction
% Diskfun is a new part of Chebfun designed for computing with
% 2D scalar and vector-valued functions defined on the unit disk. Conceptually,
% it is an extension of Chebfun2 to the polar setting, designed to accurately
% and efficiently perform over 100 operations with functions on the disk,
% including differentiation, integration, vector calculus, and rootfinding, among
% many other things. Diskfun was developed in tandem with Spherefun, and
% the two are algorithmically closely related [2,3].

%%
% To get started, we simply call the Diskfun constructor. In this example,
% we consider a Gaussian function.

g = diskfun(@(x,y) exp(-10*((x-.3).^2+y.^2)));
plot(g)
view(3)

%%
% <latex>
% When working with functions on the disk, it is sometimes convenient to
% express them in terms of polar coordinates: Given a function $f(x,y)$
% expressed in Cartesian coordinates, we apply the following transformation
% of variables:
% \begin{equation}
% x = \rho\cos\theta, \qquad y=\rho\sin\theta.
% \end{equation}
% This finds $f(\theta, \rho)$, where $\theta$ is the {\em angular}
% variable and $\rho$ is the {\em radial} variable.
% </latex>

%%
% To construct $g$ using polar coordinates, we include the
% flag |'polar'|. The result using either
% coordinate system is the same up to essentially machine precision:

f = diskfun(@(t, r) exp(-10*((r.*cos(t)-.3).^2+(r.*sin(t)).^2)), 'polar');
norm(f-g)

%%
% The object we have constructed is called a diskfun, with a lower case ``D".
% We can find out more about a diskfun by printing it to the command line.
f

%%
% <latex>
% The output describes the {\em numerical rank} of $f$ (discussed below),
% as well an approximate maximum absolute value of $f$ (the vertical scale).
% </latex>
%%
% To evaluate a diskfun, we can use either polar or Cartesian
% coordinates.  (To evaluate in polar coordinates, we need to include
% the |'polar'| flag.)

[   f(sqrt(2)/4, sqrt(2)/4)    f(pi/4,1/2, 'polar')  ]

%%
% We can also evaluate a univariate ``slice" of $f$, either radial or
% angular. The result is returned as a chebfun, either a nonperiodic or
% periodic function, respectively. Here, we plot three angular slices at
% the fixed radii $\rho = 1/4$, $1/3$, and $1/2$.

c = f( : , [1/4 1/3 1/2] , 'polar');
plot(c(:,1), 'r', c(:,2), 'k', c(:,3), 'b')
title( 'Three angular slices of a diskfun' )

%%
% Where ever possible, we interpret commands with respect to the function
% in Cartesian coordinates. So, for example, the command  |diag| returns
% the radial slice $f(x,x)$ as a nonperiodic chebfun, and  |trace| is
% the integral of $f(x,x)$ over its domain.

d = diag( f );
plot( d )
title( 'The diagonal slice of f' ), snapnow
trace_f = trace( f ) % The trace is the integral of f(x,x) over its domain  
sum( d )

%%
% Just like the rest of Chebfun, Diskfun is designed to perform operations at
% essentially machine precision, and using Diskfun requires no special
% knowledge about the underlying algorithms or discretization procedures.
% Those interested in such details can find an in-depth description of
% how Diskfun works in [3].

%% 16.2 Basic operations
% A suite of commands are available in Diskfun, and here we describe only 
% a few. A complete listing can be found by typing  |methods diskfun| 
% in the MATLAB command line.

%%
% We start by adding, subtracting, and multiplying diskfuns together:

g = diskfun(@(th, r) -40*(cos(((sin(pi*r).*cos(th)...
    + sin(2*pi*r).*sin(th)))/4))+39.5, 'polar');
f = diskfun( @(x,y) cos(15*((x-.2).^2+(y-.2).^2))...
    .*exp(-((x-.2)).^2-((y-.2)).^2));

h = g - f;
plot( h )
title( 'g - f' )

snapnow

h = g.*f;
plot( h )
title( 'g x f' )

%%
% In addition to algebraic operations, we can also solve unconstrained 
% global optimzation problems. In this example, we use the command 
% |max2| to plot $f$ along with its maximum value.

[val, loc] = max2( f )
plot( f ), hold on
axis off
colorbar
plot3(loc(1), loc(2), val, 'k.', MS, 30);
hold off

%%
% There are many ways to visualize a function on the disk and Diskfun offers
% several options. For example, here is a contour plot of $g$, with 
% the zero contours displayed as black lines:

contour(g, 'Linewidth', 1.2), hold on
axis off
contour(g, [0 0], '-k', 'Linewidth', 2)
hold off

%%
% The roots of a function (1D contours) can also be found explicitly and 
% computed with as functions. The contours are stored as a cell array of 
% chebfuns. Each cell consists of two chebfuns that parametrize the contour.

r = roots(g);
plot(g), hold on
for j = 1:length(r)
    rj = r{j};
    plot(r{j}(:,1), r{j}(:,2), '-k', LW, 3)
end
colorbar

hold off

%%
% One can also perform calculus on diskfuns. For instance, the integral of 
% the function $g(x,y) = -x^2 - 3xy-(y-1)^2$ over the unit disk can be 
% computed using the |sum2| command. We know that the exact answer is
% $-3\pi/2$.

f = diskfun(@(x,y) -x.^2 - 3*x.*y-(y-1).^2)
sum2(f)
-3*pi/2

%%
% <latex>
% Differentiation on the disk with respect to the polar variable $\rho$
% can lead to singularities, even for smooth functions.
% For example, the function $f( \theta, \rho) = \rho^2$ is smooth
% on the disk, but $\partial f/ \partial \rho = 2 \rho$ is not
% smooth. For this reason, differentiation in Diskfun is only done with 
% respect to the Cartesian coordinates, $x$ and $y$.
% </latex>

%%
% Here, we examine a  harmonic conjugate pair of functions, $u$ and $v$.
% We can use Diskfun to check that they satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
% Geometrically, this implies that the contour lines of $u$ and $v$
% intersect orthogonally.

u = diskfun(@(x,y) exp(x).*sin(y));
v = diskfun(@(x,y) -exp(x).*cos(y));
dyu = diffy(u);  % u_y
dxv = diffx(v);  % u_x

norm(dyu+dxv)             % Check u_y =- v_x

% involving the Bessel function.

%% 16.3 Poisson's equation
% <latex>
% We can use Diskfun to compute solutions to Poisson's equation on the disk.
% In this example, we compute the solution $v(\theta, \rho)$ for Poisson's
% equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition, so that
% $$ \Nabla^2 v = f, \qquad f(\theta, 1) = 1. $$
% Here, $(\theta, \rho) \in [-\pi, \pi] \times [0, 1]$ and
% $f = \sin \left( 21 \pi \left( 1 + \cos( \pi \rho)
% \right) \rho^2-2\rho^5\cos \left( 5(t-.11)\right) \right)$. The solution is
% returned as a diskfun, so we can immediately plot it, evaluate it, 
% find its zero contours, or perform other operations.
% </latex>

f = @(t,r) sin(21*pi*(1+cos(pi*r)).*(r.^2-2*r.^5.*cos(5*(t-0.11))));
rhs = diskfun(f, 'polar'); % Right-hand side
bc = @(t) 0*t+1;           % Boundary condition

%% 16.4 Vector calculus
% Since the introduction of Chebfun2, Chebfun has supported computation with
% vector-valued functions, including functions in $2D$ (Chebfun2v), $3D$
% (Chebfun3v), and spherical geometries (Spherefunv). Similarly, Diskfunv
% allows one to compute with vector-valued functions on the disk.
% Currently, there are dozens commands available in Diskfunv, including
% vector-based algebraic commands such as |cross| and |dot|,
% as well as commands that map vector-valued functions to
% scalar-valued functions (e.g., |curl|, |div| and |jacobian|)
% and vice-versa (e.g., |grad|), and commands for performing calculus
% with vector fields (e.g., |laplacian|).

%%
% To get started, we create a diskfun representing a function
% $f = \psi + \phi$, and then compute its gradient.
% The result is returned as a vector-valued object called a diskfunv, with 
% a lower case ``D".

psi = @(x,y) 10*exp(-10*(x+.3).^2-10*(y+.5).^2)+10*...
    exp(-10*(x+.3).^2-10*(y-.5).^2)+ 10*(1-x.^2-y.^2)-20;
phi = @(x,y) 10*exp(-10*(x-.6).^2-10*(y).^2);

f = diskfun( psi ) + diskfun( phi );
u = grad( f )

%%
% <latex>
% The vector-valued function $\mathbf{u}$ consists of two components,
% ordered with respect to unit vectors in the directions of $x$ and $y$,
% respectively. Each of these is stored as a diskfun. The Cartesian
% coordinate system is used because this ensures that each component is a
% smooth function on the disk. The unit vectors in the polar and radial
% directions are discontinuous at the origin of the disk, and working
% with them can lead to singularities.  We can view the vector field using 
% a quiver plot:
% </latex>

quiver(u, 'k')

%%
% <latex>
% Once a diskfunv object is created, we have overloaded dozens of commands 
% to compute with them. For example, here is a contour plot of the 
% divergence for $\mathbf{u}$.
% </latex>

D = div( u );
contour(D, 'Linewidth', 1.5), hold on
quiver(u, 'k')

hold off

%%
% <latex>
% Since $\mathbf{u}$ is the gradient of $f$, we can verify that
% $\Nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \Nabla^2 f$:
% </latex>

norm( div(u) - lap(f) )

%%
% <latex>
% Additionally, since $\mathbf{u}$ is a gradient field,
% \Nabla \cross \mathbf{u} =  0$. We can verify this with the |curl|
% command.
% </latex>

v = curl(u);
norm( v )

%%
% <latex>
% Diskfunv objects can be created through calling the constructor directly with
% function handles or diskfuns input for each component, or by vertically
% concatenating two diskfuns. Here, we demonstrate this by forming a 
% diskfunv $\mathbf{v}$ that represents the numerical surface curl for a 
% scalar-valued function $g$, i.e, $\Nabla \times [0, 0, g]$.
% </latex>

g = diskfun( @(x,y) cosh(.25.*(cos(5*x)+sin(4*y.^2)))-2 );
dgx = diffx( g );
dgy = diffy( g );

v = diskfunv(dgy, -dgx);  % call constructor
norm(v - [dgy; -dgx])     % equivalent to vertical concatenation

%%
% This construction is equivalent to using the command |curl|
% on the scalar function $g$:

%%
% To see all the available commands in the vector part of Diskfun, 
% type |methods diskfunv| in the MATLAB command line.

%% 16.5 Constructing a diskfun
% The above sections describe how to use Diskfun, and this section provides 
% a brief overview of how the algorithms in Diskfun work. This can be useful 
% for understanding various aspects of approximation involving functions 
% on the disk. More details can be found in [3], and also in the closely 
% related Spherefun chapter (Chapter 17) of the guide.

%%
% Like Chebfun2 and Spherefun, Diskfun uses a variant of Gaussian
% elimination (GE) to form low rank approximations to functions. This often results
% in a compressed representation of the function, and it also facilitates
% the use of highly efficient algorithms that work primarily on 1D
% functions.

%%
% <latex>
% To construct a diskfun from a function $f$, we consider an extended version
% of $f$, denoted by $\tilde{f}$, which is formed by taking $f(\theta, \rho)$ 
% and letting $\rho$ range over $[-1, 1]$, as opposed to $[0, 1]$.
% This is the disk analogue to the so-called double Fourier sphere method 
% discussed in Chapter 17. Also, see [1,4]. The function $\tilde{f}$ has a 
% special structure, referred to as a block-mirror-centrosymmetric (BMC) 
% structure.  By forming approximants that preserve the BMC structure of 
% $\tilde{f}$, smoothness near the origin is guaranteed. To see the BMC 
% structure, we construct a diskfun |f| and use the |pol2cart| command:
% </latex>

f= @(x,y) sech((cos(2*((2*x).^2+(2*y).^2))+sin(2*y))); 
f = diskfun(f);
tf = cart2pol(f, 'cdr') 
plot(tf)

title('The BMC function associated with f')

%%
% <latex>
% A structure-preserving method of GE (see [3])
% adaptively selects a collection of 1D circular and radial
% ``slices" that are used to approximate $\tilde{f}$. Each circular slice
% is a periodic function in $\theta$, and is represented by a trigonometric
% interpolant (or trigfun, see Chapter 11). Each radial slice, a function in
% $\rho$, is represented as a chebfun.  These slices form a low rank
% representation of $f$,
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:lra}
% f(\theta, \rho) \approx \sum_{j=1}^{n} d_jc_j(\rho)r_j(theta),
% \end{equation}
% where $\{d_j\}_{j=1}^{n}$ are pivot values associated with the GE
% procedure.
% </latex>

%%
% <latex>
% The |plot| command can be used to display the ``skeleton" of |f|:
% the locations of the slices that were adaptively selected and sampled
% during the GE procedure. Comparing the skeleton of |f| to the tensor
% product grid required to approximate $\tilde{f}$ to machine precision, we
% see that $\tilde{f}$ is numerically of low rank, so Diskfun is effectively
% compressing the representation. The clustering of sample 
% points near the center and the edges of the disk can be observed in the
% tensor product grid; low rank methods alleviate this issue in
% many instances.

% Writing the approximant as in~\eqref{eq:lra} allows us to work with it as
% a continuous analogue of a matrix factorization. The
% the ``column" (radial) slices of $f$ are the collection of Chebyshev 
% interpolants $\{ c_j(\rho)\}_{j=1}^n$, and the ``rows" of $f$ are the 
% trigonometric interpolants $\{ r_j(\theta)\}$. These can be plotted; 
% doing so we observe that each column is either even or odd, and each row 
% is either $\pi$-periodic or $\pi$-antiperiodic. This is reflective of the 
% inherent BMC structure of the approximant.
