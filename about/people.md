    <h3>Anthony Austin</h3>
    Anthony Austin started as a DPhil student at Oxford in 2012. When not
    doing research related to contour integrals, large-scale linear algebra,
    and rational approximation, he is our code guru, keeping us honest with
    object-oriented programming and Git. After Nick Hale, he is the team
    member responsible for the most lines of Chebfun v5.

    <h3>Zachary Battles</h3>
    Zachary Battles was a Rhodes Scholar and DPhil student from 2002 to 2005,
    and he wrote Chebfun version 1.  It has hard to believe it was just a few
    hundred lines of code!  Zachary introduced the recursive rootfinding
    algorithm in ROOTS as well as commands such as QR, SVD, \, RANK and COND
    for quasimatrices.

    <h3>&#193;sgeir Birkisson</h3>
    Asgeir Birkisson was an MSc and then DPhil student at Oxford from 2008 to
    2014.  With Toby Driscoll he introduced automatic differentiation into
    Chebfun and thus enabled us to solve nonlinear differential equations.  He
    also wrote CHEBGUI.

    <h3>Toby Driscoll</h3>
    Toby Driscoll, a professor at the University of Delaware, created the ODE
    and integral equations side of Chebfun starting in 2008 and has been one
    of the leaders of the Chebfun project since then. Among other codes he is
    responsible for SOLVEBVP, EIGS, EXPM, VOLT, and FRED.  He has also led
    Chebfun's movement to more advanced linear and nonlinear block structures.

    well as developing many algorithms related to solution of ODEs and PDEs
    (with Driscoll and Birkisson, including PDE15S) and fast quadrature and
    orthogonal expansions (with Townsend, including SUM, LEGPTS, CHEB2LEG, and
    CONV).  He was director of the Chebfun project from 2010 to 2014 and
    managed the creation of Chebfun version 5.

+ **Jean-Paul Berrut**, a professor at the University of Fribourg, has been a
  tireless advocate of the power of barycentric formulas for polynomial
  interpolation.  That was the idea that originally led to Chebfun.

+ **Folkmar Bornemann**, a professor at the Technical University of Munich,
  proposed the lazy evaluation idea that enabled Chebfun to represent linear
  operators and thereby solve ODEs.

+ **Jon Cherrie**, of MathWorks UK, has given the Chebfun project software
  engineering advice during the construction of version 5.

+ **Coorous Mohtadi**, of MathWorks UK, has been MathWorks' liaison with the
  Chebfun project since the company started supporting the Chebfun project in
  2011. The other principal funders of the Chebfun project have been the UK
  Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the European Research
  Council.

+ **Cleve Moler**, a great communicator and the inventor of Matlab, has been a
  inspiration to us from the beginning.
