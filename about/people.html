    and he wrote Chebfun version 1.  It has hard to believe it was just a few
    hundred lines of code!  Zachary introduced the recursive rootfinding
    algorithm in <code>roots</code> as well as commands such as
    <code>qr</code>, <code>svd</code>, <code>\</code> <code>rank</code> and

    Asgeir Birkisson was an MSc and then DPhil student at Oxford from 2008 to
    2014.  With Toby Driscoll he introduced automatic differentiation into
    Chebfun and thus enabled us to solve nonlinear differential equations.  He
    also wrote Chebgui.

    responsible for <code>solvebvp</code>, <code>eigs</code>,
    <code>expm</code>, <code>volt</code>, and <code>fred</code>. He has also
    led Chebfun's movement to more advanced linear and nonlinear block
    structures.

    (with Driscoll and Birkisson, including <code>pde15s</code>) and fast
    quadrature and orthogonal expansions (with Townsend, including
    <code>sum</code>, <code>legpts</code>, <code>cheb2leg</code>, and

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Berrut</strong>, a professor at the University of Fribourg, has been a
  tireless advocate of the power of barycentric formulas for polynomial
  interpolation.  That was the idea that originally led to Chebfun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Folkmar Bornemann</strong>, a professor at the Technical University of Munich,
  proposed the lazy evaluation idea that enabled Chebfun to represent linear
  operators and thereby solve ODEs.</p>

<p><strong>Yuji Nakatsukasa</strong>, now at the University of Tokyo, worked with Vanni
  Noferini and Alex Townsend on the fast rootfinding algorithms for Chebfun2.</p>
