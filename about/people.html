    <h3>Jared Aurentz</h3>
    After completing his PhD with David Watkins at Washington State University,
    Jared Aurentz spent 2014-16 at Oxford.  His contributions to Chebfun
    include the <code>standardChop</code> algorithm for chopping a Chebyshev series,
    the <code>adjoint</code> command for computing the adjoint of a chebop, and investigation
    of continuous analogues of Krylov iterations.

    <h3>Anthony Austin</h3>
    Anthony Austin started as a DPhil student at Oxford in 2012. A wizard
    at the fine points of Git, Matlab, and many other things, he soon became
    the leader of much of the technical side of the Chebfun operation.

    <h3>Zachary Battles</h3>
    Zachary Battles was a Rhodes Scholar and DPhil student from 2002 to 2005,
    and he wrote Chebfun version 1.  It has hard to believe it was just a few
    hundred lines of code!  Zachary introduced the recursive rootfinding
    algorithm in <code>roots</code> as well as commands such as
    <code>qr</code>, <code>svd</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>rank</code> and
    <code>cond</code> for quasimatrices.

    &#193;sgeir Birkisson was an MSc student, DPhil student, and then postdoc
    at Oxford from 2008 to 2015 and is responsible for a large part of
    of Chebfun's ODE capabilities.  His contributions included automatic differentiation
    for nonlinear boundary-value problems (with Toby Driscoll), automatic detection of
    linearity of chebops, extension of the backslash syntax to IVPs as well as
    BVPs, and the graphical user interface Chebgui.
    &#193;sgeir is coauthor with Trefethen
    and Driscoll of the book in preparation <em>Exploring ODEs</em>.

    responsible for <code>solvebvp</code>, <code>eigs</code>,
    <code>expm</code>, <code>volt</code>, and <code>fred</code>.  Together with
    Nick Hale, he developed the rectangular and block spectral discretizations
    used in all of Chebfun's BVP computations, and is coauthor with Trefethen

    (with Driscoll and Birkisson, including <code>pde15s</code>) and fast
    quadrature and orthogonal expansions (with Townsend, including
    <code>sum</code>, <code>legpts</code>, <code>cheb2leg</code>, and

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Jean-Paul Berrut</strong>, a professor at the University of Fribourg, has been a

<p><strong>Folkmar Bornemann</strong>, a professor at the Technical University of Munich,
  proposed the lazy evaluation idea that enabled Chebfun to represent linear
  operators and thereby solve ODEs.</p>
